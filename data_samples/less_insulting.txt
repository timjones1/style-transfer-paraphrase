Our oils read;  President IS taking different tactics to deal with a corrupt malignant, hipoctitical , one way press! Idiots forget what witnessed them doing during the last election process.
The profoundly stupid have spoken.
The ignorance and bigotry comes from your post!
An "abject lesson" is a lesson that is painful or humiliating.  "Object" on the other hand is a noun--it is not even an adjective, it is not a descriptor of any kind per se.  It is entertaining though, to see a semi-literate boob getting advice from another semi-literate boob.
Right on the money Gary Crum. And if they hide behind the anonymity of masks and the mob, they're cowards to boot.
Hey Dallas, Don't let the Iditarod get the best of you.  Do the 2018 race.  Yes, the ITC is a bunch of malicious idiots.  But they will all retire/die soon, long before your career is even half over.  They can't charge you with anything because of the way the rules are for 2017 (the ITC has to prove intent, but they can't).  So get back to training your dogs, win the 2018 race ... and give the senile geezers of the ITC the finger.
I can't believe this country was so stupid.. -totally dumbstruck- you get what you get and don't throw a fit!
Only in America can you get 25 likes for admitting you are pathetic. But seriously financial destitution is a pretty common thing in a state where booms and busts happen with great regularity. The weird thing is an occasional bust might not be such a bad thing, If Alaska became the "Land of Milk and Honey" everyone would want to live here. A huge influx of people would slowly destroy the wilderness that keeps many of us here. But perhaps more importantly with the pressures bust's produce comes innovation and a role up your sleeves attitude which often leads to prosperity of the soul if not the pocketbook. The pathetic thing is when people get too comfortable they get lazy and complacent. This can happen to individuals and even to the things humans create like pipelines, legislative bodies or permanent funds. We live in chaotic times but we might end up better for it with some time out to think.
"Just saw headlines on a couple of sites where Pres. Elect Trump is saying again that the election was rigged and that he would otherwise have also won the popular vote."  I saw those stories as well. I've come across sore losers before, but Trump seems to be a sore winner.
If a News person dies for ratings are we suppose to cry or cheer ? Get away from the storm you idiots!!!!!!!!!!!
Sounds more like the Antifascists are the real fascists...hey Antifa, have you suppressed opposing speech yet today? Attacked those you disagree with? Burned any buildings or cars?Those fools are so stupid they actually think they are espousing Americans traits...  Definition of fascism 1 often capitalized : a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition
Lying slut slut slut, wants money now
Dictionary definition:  Militia 1.(a) org., any military force... Either you are too ignorant or stupid to read the first dictionary definition.  The only "Well-regulated Militia" legally existing in the U.S. is those under the Department of Defense.  Your definition only applies to those white supremacist private militia created by your fellow racists and bigots under Posse Comitatus idiocy roaming the nation to intimidate government employees and scared citizens.  The current examples sitting in jail in Oregon.  A "Well-regulated Militia" has been in existence for most of the history of the nation without any need for civilian weaponry to defend it.  The only need for civilian weapons is for hunting or protection; therefore all should be licensed and registered with full background checks before ownership like any other threat to other citizens in the wrong hands.
Well its official  51 vs 49.  Yea!  Victory Victory is our cry!  Dumb republicans. Shame they didn't just support single pay health care.  Well maybe now they will.  lololol
It's great that their community can preserve something important to them.  The one issue I'd take up with the author is with his repeated reference to lack of government support: "Despite virtually no government support for our language" "Governments have not considered our language worth supporting" It's not the government's role to preserve someone's culture.  Silly assumption.
More baloney.  WA Post reported emails of Manafort turning down efforts regarding Russia. AND, there is nothing wrong with any candidate having contact with a foreign leader.  Last, there is no way Putin himself would have been involved in any "collusion" directly.  Like saying Don Corleone was going to directly rub out someone.
Workaholic ... you mean the Pres who takes of every weekend and goes golfing. Lol - what a sick joke that is. So far his biggest job has been throwing rolls of paper towels at Puerto Ricans .  And when he's not on the golf course he spends most of his time on the porcelain throne tweeting out idiot comments.
yep , always someone elses fault . Yet another hateful bully racist . Why dont you go crawl under a rock ?
Not to mention indiscriminate barrel bombing women and children. Assad is a butcher with no morals.
The Chinese aren't stupid enough to believe anything that comes out of his mouth...in any language.
A wise person pointed out that a lot of people voted for Trump hoping he was a hypocrite and a liar, a lot voted against him because they believed he says what he means - and Vladimir Putin supports Trump because he believes Trump says what he means.
C:  Yeah, this issue is about Anchorage, not the federal government.  Apparently you don't understand the difference.  You have no idea who anyone voted for but that doesn't stop your inane rantings.  You need to get a life.
The mom is a scumbag, I remember thinking that after her comments on her other sons murder charges. Lock her up with the rest of the degenerates!
WTF is hamilton smoking? He needs some mindless words from willams to inspire him? The problem with the internet is reportig non news like williams baby and hamilton is a moron
Unfortunately, Putin is far from stupid. Two stupid people working together might be safer - at least they could be controlled by their party handlers. One incredibly shrewd and absolutely unscrupulous actor (Putin was high up in the KGB, remember - those people weren't stupid) manipulating the other like a cheap marionette is a recipe for danger. It reminds me of nothing as much as the relationship between a certain German leader of the previous century and his unwitting Italian accomplice.
He wanted to start a family in Syria but he's not Syrian.   In other words he wanted to be a Islamist colonialist settler, establish an Islamic state or caliphate in Syria, steal land and property from Syrians and kick the Syrians out of their own country or else kill them.  The Syrian people did not invite these Islamist terrorist scum into their country.  Good thing this piece of garbage is history as far as I am concerned.
Trump is a smuck, should be fired. in the first 3 days new news Trump to hire his own news team, which we will have to trust. Called RT-Trump.
This article is pure rubbish.
You know, honestly many are just loosing hope anymore. This hateful group of cowards are successfully destroying the United States. Look at how many likes he got for suggesting such a thing. They don't think about wether it's the right person, the right to a defense etc.. They are like a bunch of junk yard dogs. It's almost amusing how Trump manipulated them to gain power isn't it? These people have no thought process in regard to their condemnation. I guess the Middle East won after all because these idiots gave them their way. Divide and conquer is easily done with the stupid, manipulated and afraid. Trust this, that lot will be the first ones to bend over and give Hitler their guns when asked lol!
Serafim Saovskii, your hatred of Jews has evolved over time in its manifestations and disguises and one can see all three forms in abundance here. Read some history and maybe you'll understand a thing or two about reality. Your antisemitism is disgusting.
These "alaskans" sound like a bunch of fnken slaves! They aren't alaskans but crybabies who are afraid of being left without a parental figure to take care of them. Always preferring job security and status quo over brutal freedom. Tundra ain't California. Annoying.
Trump is comically thin-skinned and the press is making him look stupid, so of course he's going to do whatever he can to sideline them, try to lift up those "alternative" news outlets that are friendly to him to take their place, and make up whatever positive spin he can to convince himself, and his followers, that he's on top of his game.  When it doesn't work he's going to get frustrated and bored, and then someone like Jared Kushner will be the functioning president, forwarded in the next election cycle as Trump's successor---And Trumpkins across the nation will fawn all over him, for whatever that'll be worth.    Hopefully the economy won't be in a tailspin by then, but if it is, they'll have a newly minted democratic congress and senate to blame it on...
Are you trying to say that black people are more likely to be mentally ill murderers?
Trump has been around this long only because he’s a white guy with tons of white privilege. He should have been gone a long time ago, especially after screaming “tell ‘em to go f**k themselves” at a campaign and bragging about being able to grab women by their pu**y because he’s rich and famous.
I hope all you Far Left whiners don't go out and commit suicide based on the Comey hearing today.  Your leadership and the news media has led you over the cliff with their fictitious articles and speeches.  You need to go back to the election and not accept the false narrative that Clinton lost the election because of the Russians.  Clinton lost because she was a poor candidate under investigation by the FBI.  Get over it.
That idiot, Pelosi, was complaining that the POTUS wasn't visiting the countries he's visiting on this trip alphabetically.
"Councilmembers Ron Menor, Ikaika Anderson, Joey Manahan, Kymberly Pine and Brandon Elefante joined Ozawa"  These are the ones that need to be voted out next election!  Bunch of clowns.
Obviously you are the one as dumb as a rock.  The Donald said that he would before he said he wouldn't.  That makes him a LIAR.  You may continue to believe he is not but this conversation is over.
Canada with seat on the U.N security council means NOTHING unless Canada has some magical influence over Russia and China.  This is just a pipe dream for Little PM Pixie Dust.  Wake up Canada before this intellectual moron gets us into a war.
another lib troll of complete stupidity, our child PM hasnt handled anyone , he pays off people but handles no one that matters,, trump is running over our pm , this kid is about gender bs not business and trade.. you ignorant shill liberals hate to admit this  so we continue to see this kind of ignorant lying propaganda that doesnt work and will prove you libs out of office in a few years...
The Trudeau liberals are trying once again to fix a problem that doesn't need fixing. Canada does not have the extremes of wealth and poverty of the US.   He is tying to pass off tax credits targeted specifically  for the middle class as tax breaks for the wealthy. Seriously? Do you think the rich need a fitness tax credit or a tax credit for their bus pass? lol  These guys are morons.
You aren't that dumb are you,  really.  Gender police?  I'm pretty sure that if you line up 100 people, I can tell if they are male or female.  Go back to smoking your hooch and watching CNN.
YOU ARE SO FULL OF SHIT......THE MORE HE ATTACKS PRESS.....,THE MORE I LOVE HIM
Bruce IS a born and raised there Californian.  And he is Pure WT.  That moron is doing as much damage as he can thoughout his life.   Considering that the dems are NOT the ones that run up massive debts, but the GOP does, says that you should fear the GOP much more.  For example, 2/3 of COlorado's debt comes from Owens and the GOP.  It is no different in the federal budget. It is the GOP that continues to blow through money.  ACA was fully funded, and now, the GOP is purposely playing games and driving the price up. OTOH, the Medicare Part D that was created by the GOP and voted in by the GOP, cost MORE than ACA, serves a small fraction of citizens, and was not funded for a single penny. It all comes from general revenue.
A day late and a dollar short.  And then to slam the CEO of Merck Pharmaceuticals for quitting his post on Trump's manufacturing council over Trump's initial response show just how much of racist bigot he is.   Deflect to Obama all you want. Trump is still a racist bigot and he is currently the POTUS not Obama.
The ninth district should be broken up. It makes no sense that liberal states like California and states like Idaho under the same liberal idiots. If the justices were elected by the people it would be a different situation.
And the hits just keep on coming. Nunes is as crooked as Trump.
Let's see, Tory, Wynne, Trudeau, Nutley, etc: A nasty disaster is in store for us Canadians
Jews are the worst people on the planet. They lie, cheat, and destroy entire nations. They have no boundaries, moral or ethical, when it comes to dealing with the gentiles. They only thing they worship is the almighty fiat money. Those are facts.
I called in to report a lady today on W. 11th in a Blue 4-runner just goofing off with her phone in hand who almost hit me.  She was weaving in and out of lanes with no signals, being oblivious. Then this idiot acted like I was wrong for noticing.  I don't play around, I got her plates, description and called it in right away. I doubt anything was done. Sadly,  most drivers don't care and rarely do law enforcement. My guess is EPD didn't even respond. How many does it take to die over a darn phone?
Nice try Putin.  We're not as dumb as you need us to be, sorry.
I will never give it up.  You may not mind that the president has broken tradition but I sure do.  He has lied and so I will always remind people like you who forget that we have a big fat liar for president.
Because liberals want everything their way, and if you disagree in any way with them you're "ignorant". They are mad Trump does the crap that they do to conservatives all the time. Do you think Obama would allow an interview with a bunch of conservative news paper columnists asking hard questions? He never did.
An excellent idea! Boot out the liars and fakes from cnn and other hack jobs. Get to business and get things done without a bunch of snowflakes asking rigged stupid questions.
You sound jealous.  And you sound like a typical troll.
Bullshit.  If you are black the rules are different.
Trump is a freaking moron. His lack of foreign policy is frankly dangerous. Other US  officials have to constantly walk back his bluster.  He so unqualified it's embarrassing. This isn't a land deal. We are talking about lives and peace at stake.
Begging for war by the insane : Trump, ain"t no big deal? who knew?
So the jerk making false arrest threats was an ATF agent. Should "we the people" be less worried, or MORE?  "Official business"? Bull!
Crooked lieberals. Any surprise ?
Some of these comments are obviously from Syria's useful idiots.   Look, even if it is the rebels who used the gas, what choice did they have? Assad is a monster, and with Putin's backing he is winning. What are they supposed to do, just let him? Not everyone gets to survive war. Sometimes innocents are sacrificed. It's ugly but the rebels need our support and showing the world the risks is justified.
Yep.  Thing is, it's also falling on the Democrats.  This "ban" originated during the Obama administration by Obama himself.  The Dems do this garbage too.  But it's rare I hear their supporters have issue with it until a Republican does it.
This is the lowest mud slinging yet from Trudeau; dirty dirty dirty
Does this nutcase not realize how many people died on 9/11? Does she really think her losing the Pres election equates to that many lives being lost? Rather than blame Russia, Comey, Bernie, etc., why doesn't she just ask those of us who voted for Obama but not her why we didn't vote for her. She will hear about a lack of accomplishment, bad decisions, the Clinton Foundation, the arrogance, the corruption. She will hear many of us made our minds up the day she forced herself, I mean announced her candidacy. She ran a horrible campaign. We saw it. We lived through it. She makes herself look foolish when she offers these lame untrue excuses.
When was the last time you read ANY ARTICLE by the local media actually criticizing any coaching decision made by Mark Helfrich? Every article deceptively spins and twists statistics to try to defend Mark. Do your job media! Talk about how he has failed, as I am tired of reading you DANCE AROUIND the issue of poor coaching. Sick and tired of in state media members lecturing fans about how they are spoiled and ignorant. The national media is honest and think it’s OBVIOUS Helfrich should go. Comparing only wins and losses and not looking deeper is dishonest and shameless. I assert the local condescending Oregon media is trying to protect their own jobs and interests, and don’t actually care about keeping the Ducks great. Being gutless mouthpiece for Mark Helfrich makes people lose respect and not want to read your articles.
What we need is more people that care about themselves and quit being ok with just being street trash
"Mr. Trump has done more for Americans in under 100 days than Obama did in 8 years." Come on Dolphin, that's just ridiculous.
Voter fraud?!?! Do you believe that he won 335 electoral colleges and 51% popular vote  in a fradulent way? Should everything you don't like be regarded as fake? Donkeys think better than you. Shameful idiotic trumpler. You are simply a burden for this country
So abject stupidity is a prerequisite for getting a CNN show?? Does Jimbo realize that the poem he so reverently worships was written as part of a fund raiser for the SOL pedestal? Nah I didn't think so. As far as Trump wanting to control the ethnic make-up of our country, so what?? The Democrats openly stated their determination to make America "browner" when they drastically altered the immigration policies 50 years ago. (They even said America would be "better" if we changed to a "brown" country without explaining why). The level of self-hate and loathing with liberals is appalling.
Trudeau is so pathetic leader that he actually says he will do local meetings with Canadians rather then go to Trump's inauguration?.....what a bunch of B.S, When has Trudeau ever not wanted to do "selfies".
Us hard working taxpayers continue to get raped financially by this liberal government!!! Sorry folks but every single person in this country has some form of injustice done to them - now does that mean that every injustice needs to be financially compensated?? I think the government might as well hand over $10 million cash to everybody to solve all the problems since they seem to think handouts solve the problems. This is really getting stupid!!!
Comey, just another lying law enforcement official. And to think he actually was the top dog at th FBI.
My favorite is the piece done on two women that said Trump harassed them. The reporter made up a whole bunch of things that the women said they never did say. The NY Times is the slim of so called reporting. There are no respectful news outlets left in this country. They get a story and add all their own views and not telling the real stuff. The news these days is just a hunk of crap. Except when the Post says the Bronco's are gong down the toilet.
As Matt Taibbi aptly described these hooligans:  "...these people may be dangerous, but their boundless self-pity, their outrageous sense of entitlement and their slapstick incompetence as rebels and terrorists are absolutely ridiculous."
I believe your whole post is contained in your last sentence, but I can't personally appreciate the jolly remarks about Trump and Spicer.  They are both LYING INTENTIONALLY to the American people,  and even with my twisted sense of humor I can't chuckle or even snort.  I applaud almost everything you write, so this isn't meant as a criticism...what those two buffoons are doing should be halted, and damned fast.   Blessings to you (anyway).  😎
Junior is either an uneducated moron or a shameless pathological liar. Frankly I’ll argue it’s both. No matter how many times these shameless liars claim we hate Latino’s the issue remains; we hate illegal immigration and our laws not being enforced. As for this profound stupidity demonizing our corn, this staggering hypocrite has absolutely no problem with Mexico exporting cheap agriculture produce to America that created thousands of jobs in Mexico and South America. While Junior laughably claims we have killed thousands of corn growing jobs in Mexico, this clueless wonder says nothing of the tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs we exported to Mexico. As for our unconstitutional illegal war on drugs, this has exposed naked just how corrupt the Mexican government is. Legalize all drugs and Mexico is still ran by criminals as they have ALWAYS been a corrupt country.
Bull shit there is no Race about it so let's not even go there to nsf it had to end up with someone dying over stupidity
THAT WAS MY POINT, DICK. Holy hell. Christians=Muslims. It's all the same.
We require people to take a test before granting them a license to drive, but any idiot can have children, and as many of them as possible. This guy should be required to undergo a vasectomy.
Exact opposite of what if happening in the States.  Trudeau is the new corrupt 'leader' on the block garnering favours from the elite be it China or super rich Muslim Imams.  Sooner or later someone is going to have to come to grips with Trump eating our lunch and even the useful idiots will finally take notice.
Ignorant and uneducated. Your intelligence is lacking at best. I'd be happy to debate you and embarrass you on the lack of factual information swimming around in your confused head.
The idiocy of this trend is neatly captured in this joke: "Please Sir, can I have some more...is it organic?"
these fools thought we held football higher than God, family and country.    not me.
Oh,  btw, the stands are still full.   Your 'majority' is a small group of flag waving racist nazis following a cowardly draft dodger.
Another IDIOT...........MILLIONS out there............
predictably you cannot refute the facts, and like an intellectually bankrupt coward deflect to mindless drivel. But that is expected from people like you. I did give you substance, but you ran like an intellectually bankrupt coward.
With love that the Donald provides who needs hatred?  lol    I am not upset that Hillary lost but I am disgusted that we now have a president who has no idea of what the hell he is doing.  I also dislike having a president who is dishonest.  (He promised to release his taxes before he decided not to.)  My question to you Wazdat is what will it take to wake you up to this fraud?  Another economic meltdown similar to what we experienced under the prior republican president?  I also am against wholesale corruption which this president is now giving us.    Sad thing is the Donald has no idea what his job is.  His desire to slash the budgets for the secretary of state and things such as NOAA are just stupid.  Just curious, will you enlist if he gives us another war?   But hay he sure sucks up federal money playing golf and traveling.  Way to go.
I am guessing that you not only believed kremlin ads but shared them too. Poor dupe.
Actually, the Mayor of San Juan is a more experienced elected official and public servant than Donald J. Trump.   She held her first press conference on the afternoon of the hurricane after herself having accompanied City officials making preliminary assessments of the damage, and specifically addressed the total obliteration of the housing built along the Martin Pena Canal.   She is absolutely right in pointing out that the island is only 100 miles by 35 miles, and that by now, basic relief supplies (water, fuel, food) could and should have reached any point on the island by appropriately sized military helicopter.   She is showing better, smarter leadership than the thin skinned, sociopathic Trump.
I applaud the French government for assuring that people can vote without fear of being attacked by some deranged idiot  who thinks he can change the world with a bomb or a gun.  The only party that gains from terrorism is the Front National. Hopefully fear will never triumph over reason.  We'll see tomorrow.
Now maybe this defense will shut their holes and quit trying to blame, you all SUCK!
He’s been a hypocrite carney barker for years; this is just further confirmation of him being a degenerate.
I'm going to throw up :/ I will do all the design work and fabrication for free. Wait no, I forgot, the whole idea is so completely stupid. Fire everyone! I'm so bummed out because this is how ALL the government thinks. They can't think! They think they can think, but they can't.
All hail "The Ugly American,"  he's back, bigger and uglier.
There was no discussion of the "burka" during the election. However, Harper and his gang of ignorant xenophobes lost the election because of their proposed niqab ban and their proposed "snitch line" — views and values that Canadians, by and large, found repugnant.
Absolutely, Hillary and her band of bandits, with her foundation that stole billions, her emails, her massive immigration, Soros, #pizzagate, rape, murder, Podesta, HUMA embarrassment, Benghazi..yup Trump is right up there>>LOL<<<
It provably too late now, however, if you CI clergies & religious all speak up with 'Christ-like integrity' against clergy sex abuses of children, this problem will end in no time! Yet you unethical, pompous attitude of believe in religious superiority as a clergies/religious decide to support the rapes of children by your silence till your soul will 'burn in hell'. You clergies/religious do not believe there is a living God who is immanent in children, do you? You don't believe in Holy Mary who is the mother of all souls on earth, do you?  If you do not believe in these spiritual realities on earth, just give up being a clergy/religious!  I think we can do all better without you spiritual hypocrites!
Good! Now let's hope it goes out of business altogether. The the rich, pampered babies can join Kapernick in the unemployment line. Couldn't happen to a better group of jerks.  My personal van on the NFL Began 15 years ago.
I just finished reading "Panic: The Story of Modern Financial Insanity" by Michael Lewis.  Four recent financial conflagrations are covered, with the inclusion of happy-talk columns before each, befuddled items during the panics, and post-panic articles that show we have not learned very much from them.    Of course the final section is about the housing bubble (boosted by Greenspan) that investment banks are still totally responsible for, and for which they have not been sufficiently punished.  Return of Glass-Steagall would bar investment banks from f**king over consumers, and would make consumer banking the dull business it should be.  No chance of that.  CNBC's Jim Kramer is unmasked, once again, as the idiot he has always been.  Now it's the credit card debt that is ballooning.  I once gave a commencement address that, before delving into the expected high-toned prose, advised graduates to attack their credit-card debt (even before student loans) and to never incur it again.
........... said the blind dumb and deaf lemming.
Raise your hand if poaching near Native villages surprises you.  Anyone?  Anyone?  Didn't think so.  Idiots like this dolt don't give the bison herd a chance for long term survival.
Mean, spiteful, liars, power abusers, willing to pervert justice for political power---all those traits Nixon is accused of having are now resident in the Democrat Party and leftwing journalists. Carl, YOU are Nixon. YOU are despicable.
you do not know shi@t.  quit commenting on every frickin article and keep your pie hole shut
The DUMBEST BUFFOON EXCUSE FOR A PRESIDENT THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN!
only the ignorant left thing trump is a disaster when its the congress so far, trump is doing pretty good over all getting much done
"High on stupid".  You nailed it!  Millet: "I guess I was stupid to wanna spend 32 million on new office digs.  So heck, it will be less stupid to spend 12 million!"  Plus 6 million for remodeling and office furniture, 2 million for computers and networks, another 2 million a year for taxes, insurance, security and maintenance.  Total: 20 million.   Leasing existing space at the Atwood would be much less.  But hey, what does money mean to a Millet when a fast talking real estate agent is trying to impress her.  After all, it's someone else's money.
More Garbage Journalism.
This "phenomenon" underscores a very salient point, within mine own mind.  Rather than individuals taking control of technology so as to utilize it within a positive manner, the have allowed technology to take control of them within a negative manner.  Turn OFF your damn phones and be human, once again!
The man has some money to burn, stupidly, he is despised by the Socialists he supports and his crony money river doesn't run by his home anymore.  He is an example how corruption can make a stupid person very rich.
Everyone knows he's guilty as hell, only a brain dead moron doesn't see it!
While it's true that all media make mistakes, it's foolish to brand all of them as the enemy.  Yes, one should also keep the bullshit monitor turned on, should always be skeptical, but effectively putting Breitbart and its ilk in the same class as NYT, NBC, WaPo, CBC, etc. is just stupidly self-defeating.
Oh shut up.
Mr. Barbour looks like an unremorseful schmuck in that photo.  I hope the defense attorney lies awake at night after selling lies to an impartial jury of peers. Pathetic.
these republican legislators are despicable. come on voters, remove these clowns from office.no one should promote these bills.
Dumb racist slurs have no place on the G&M or any other Canadian publication. You will be more comfortable on Breitbart or one of the Russian controlled outlets.
I see a HILLARY CLINTON troll. She lost. She's a loser
To say nothing of unceasing barrage of manufactured scandals, such as changes to the census form (of all things!), robocalls (even my kid's school uses them!), and a host of others. But liberal voters even found a way to pin the blame for Walkerton on Mike Harris when the fault lay with the criminally fraudulent conduct of the two brothers who actually ran the facility, and who, in case you're interested, received grossly inadequate punishments.  Liberals are the sorest losers in the world. Because their position is based on emotion, they identify with it, wholly and completely. To reject a liberal's ideas is to reject him, and they respond with hate and venom, all the while accusing you of the same. After election night, campus snowflakes needed Play-Doh, colouring books, therapy dogs, safe circles, scream sessions, and group therapy sessions to deal with the loss. When was the last time you saw such psychoses from conservatives?
nonsense ............... iPhones are not garbage  Your 'alternate facts' are garbage
No one is advocating protecting criminals?  Then explain Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez and the actions of the San Francisco County Sheriff.    The "reality" is illegal immigrants ARE killing people!  http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/21/mother-of-son-murdered-by-illegal-alien-slams-sanctuary-cities-politicians-your-silence-speaks-volumes/  No more  federal funds to Washington State and federal charges levied on all elected officials and others that continue this ridiculous  "sanctuary" status will make heads snap.
Yes!  God yes!  Someone finally called out those damn evangelicals!  I hate how they are always running around trying to help the poor, when we KNOW that is the government's job.  LOL
Women are trying to be the men and the men..well they have to the be women. Feminism is a fad and eventually it will die out but until then these millennials are some sad puppies in socialigical-experiement gone mad.  :  Women are told to reject men, reject being a mother, a wife, a nurturer then even reject sex because you know, men are rapists. And now they must compete with them men at everything. This is no communist love-in, it is pure 3rd reich capitalism - work will set you free! But will it make you happy?  :  The guys, what do they need to do anything for, who are they working to impress, to provide for, to be the man of the what house? Are they suppose to be the protector of women or in competition with them?
We need to remember.... the right smart liberals told us dumb electorate this already .... this is all far to complicated for us to possibly understand, so they won't bother trying to explain it to us dummies.  Just accept their word, 'cause they are good for it. Right?   Unbelievable.
Someone needs to put trump in a mental hospital for the insane. Next he'll blame Obama for his small hands and bald head. Trump lunatic in chief.
Curse those radicalized Lutherans!
In a free country everyone is entitled to their opinion, no matter how stupid.
LIberal Democrats are bunch of Liars, Deceivers, Haters, etc.. The ballgames over, the unity is over as Pelosi and others are already blaming the Right as to why their constituent went out and sought to Kill Republicans. Democrats M.O. = never accept blame, it's someone else is at fault.
As I have said before, anyone who calls Pope Francis a Marxist is either a fool or a liar. Same for Obama or Hillary Clinton. Do any of you rightists have a clue about what Marxism is?  And anyone who calls for a missile strike clearly is no Christian.
When the terrorist this am stopped someone and asked if it was democrats or republicans playing on the field....then that's a terrorist.  I wish the media didn't just call a person a terrorist because of their religion.  How stupid is that?!
motley:  There is NO question HE is an OLD FOOL, and OLD Druggie.    In his mind, HE is supplying a 25 year old woman with METH, and getting that young woman Bang Job, just what ALL of us OLD guys fantasize about, right????   Both these people need Drug Intervention and Mental Illness Intervention.
I want to separate out the nonsense of the Kathy Griffins and Ted Nugents of the world from stuff that really matters. Show business people are, for the most part, self-indulgent children, and the fact that technology gives them all kinds of platforms these days doesn't mean they are worth paying attention to.  But what elected officials say and do does matter. I'm not so naive as to believe there ever was a time in U.S. history when politicians were governed by either civility or honesty, but the wildcard today is the immediate impact their words can have, and rarely for good.  Trump's insomnia-driven tweets aren't harmless. One stupid comment from him at 4 a.m. can dominate the news cycle for the next 24 hours, putting Democrats into response mode and Republicans into damage control mode. And while all that's happening, the work of the country isn't getting done.  This president's lack of personal discipline exhausts Congress, the media and the nation. And that's not a good thing.
Don't forget serial rapist and liar Bill Clinton!!!
Not only he is a bad businessman but also a douchs that ruined the mural!! What an effing jerk!!
This is bullshit and not true who ever said it lied and
for the lunatics who think the planet is about to be burnt out,, get some mental help, there is no fact to support the usual made up scare tactic lies.
' …how bout, just for starters,    ….he's as ignorant as a fence post. . . How to resist Trump, …something for everybody,  …practical actions everyone can join in on.

The eurocrat thugs of Brussels, are all the same. Wether they be running, the IOC, FIFA or the EU, they are nothing more than elite pigs at the tough. One generation away from Nazi appeasement, these truffle eaters will never change. Britain is far better off without them.
That's pathetic. poor you
It's really hard to understand the breathtaking incompetence of this entire administration.  Trump seems to have looked under every rock to find the absolute worst person available for almost every job.  Trump is veering toward impeachment or removal from office because of mental fitness.  He's obviously a psychotic.
How to explain Trump's comments?  Trump is an imbecile.  That's how to explain it.  His administration has failed and will continue  to fail.  He's a worthless POS.
Can't fix stupid.
Whats disrespectful is Bill's behavior.  He was a married man.  That makes him a cheater..  While acting POTUS, disgusting.  No way in HELL can a blow job in the Oral Office be neutered.  However show biz people are known for multi sex. opposite sec, homo sex, cheating sex and divorcing and getting married again.  NO ONE in show biz is expected to behave civily.  They are professional LIARS for their lifeschoice work.  How honorable is that?  And why shouldn't  Bill stay married to Hillary?  He knows he can cheat all he wants.  And Trumps marriage will remain in tact. Guaranteed.  You give me a time and a number, I'll take your bet.  And I don't gamble.
Are you serious - coming from a serial adulterer, abuser and mendacious narcissist - oh yes, a very religious man. Not in Canada eh! We have a little more sense!
He is pure evil. He is a pathological narcissist/sociopath and unfit for office.
to become instead a truly non-partisan body of sober second thought.,, oh ibbitson you idiot, it is still a party hack club ,
Yet another useless compilation of ridiculous observations (3000 sit-ups, beard and weird hair.......really?) presented by the king of bombastic irrelevance. Rather than providing some insight to the history and significance of this wonderful derby we get "reformed cannibal". Pathetic!
What is this? Secret society garbage?   Was the teacher who kept calling/harassing the parent a brainwashed and manipulated member?   To hear this story makes one wonder what was really going on.
Also,  why would they want the police defending them?  I thought they wanted cops to "fry like bacon"?  Ah, now that they want someone to defend them, they cowardly run to the cops for protection with tails between legs. Lol typical leftist fascists.
You're a troll. Get your own account troll.
How sad that we have a dunce for a president. He always has a look like he messed his underoos or wants to. Keep the idiot home from the summit and send the White House custodian. At least we would have an adult representing our country and not an immature 71 year old just occupying a seat.
Seminole, I'm very familiar with your Republican go-to document and website. But it is hardly the only one. Shall I break out my far-from-obscure sources that gainsay yours? Why should you hire black people, other than the law? I mean, we know how stupid and what horrible workers they are. Same with pot. You know it's the devil's drug. Your government has made that very clear.  Blumstein, Alfred, and Kimonori Nakamura. “Redemption in the Presence of Widespread Criminal Background Checks.” NIJ Journal, Issue No. 263 (2009): 10-17. Google 	Scholar. Web. 2 Feb. 2013.
This idiot that we have for BOC president recently hiked rates twice while the Canadian economy was stumbling into contraction.  This , at a time when Canadian household debt is at record high levels and Canadian household income levels under attack by the tax and waste Trudeau Govt. Is it any wonder why our economic outlook is so uncertain. Comsumers still form 70% of our economy, so a weak economic outlook is not surprising after that one-two punch in the gut .  What is also not surprising is the mismanagement of our economy by the Trudeau Liberals .  Can you imagine how awful they are when a $20 billion deficit elicits a contraction in GDP?  Surely, Canadians deserve better husbandy of their hard earned taxes
Idiot.
Your right because my moron will do less damage to the country than your moron. I win either way with privatization.  So what's your point? I don't want to assume you're just trying to take a cheap shot. That would just make you look cowardly.
well patuk , guess what, your hero hillbilly will soon be under inditement. meanwhile, trump is trying to clean up the country of ner do wells. with a name like patuk, i suspect you are one of the jerks he will kick out soon.
Wait a minute. You hypocrites got all over Big Tobacco for marketing "towards" kids. Now the government is backing Chocolope and Lemon Drop? Sounds like a vape shop. What happened to Kona Gold and Kauai Electric?
What a hypocritical lot these Liberals are.    We've suffered through Trudeau the Elder, now we suffer under Trudeau the Liar.  Sunny Daze!
You are pathetic. Feigning ignorance. That's an old, old dodge.
Your 6-3 decision came from the MSM sloptrough. Try pulling your head out and take the time to look it up. You "losers" can learn something. October the SCOTUS will hear arguments. The vote was a 9-0 slap in the face for you clowns. So get over it.
it only works in china because the dissenters are killed...you are pathetic, along with justin.
The cucks in charge of this rag are lower than dirt.
There are stupid gullible  people who will believe this garbage research. Unfortunately, you cannot stop it but I feel sorry for the gullible people who will destroy their lives because they believe it.
Fools and their money are soon parted.
Hilarious.  Are we supposed to believe Robert "Third" Reeeeeeiich?   An overpaid talking piece for the Clintons.  Once again the ADN rag filling their fire stove firestarter newspaper with left leaning trash.
My mistake. You and all the other lunatics in the asylum.
Nooo. Trump conspired with Kathy Griffin to post that video of his severed head.  The purpose was to give ISIS some recruiting material and to motivate them as they fight for their sorry lives.  Trump is not a Russian agent...He's a damn JIHADIST IN THE WHITEHOUSE!  OMG!
we have come to the conclusion you are an idiot.. .. kids need to play and not be coddled..
Nothing but a liar​ and a hypocrite?  Is more . . . he's an idiot and a narcissist.
hey loser, meat is a necessity of life, you know FOOD, an electric car is NOT!,,, by your nonsense i guess we should be subsidizing hot air baloons so people can fly to work too!
Yeah, Putrumpski has broken "norms" all right; like not being a traitor,not being disloyal to your country; not being a pathological liar, not being a sexual predator, not being a tax cheat, lying about your connections with an unfriendly, murderous, foreign ex-KGB dictator who launched a cyber-attack on your countries most important electoral process(and who knows what else) in order to ensure his pet candidate won the Presidential election. There lost more but that's enough to start.  The bigger issue are the similarly repugnant so-called American voters who not only willingly fell for every single lie, but continue to fall for them in the face of evidence exposing them as lies,  and to wilfully, knowingly, support the installation of a patently illegitimate, traitorous President-Elect in the White House.
Here we go... Stupid driver no 3 of the day. When are these dingleberrys going to get the memo about driving stupid drunk.
Such blatant hypocrisy.  Thanks for being predictable Layla.
Nor about you. Try reading the story before commenting; it'll make you look less foolish.
How so? FBI table 6. It's not that difficult. And you actually try to deny the racist arguments going on here. SO pathetic.
More of that rugged individualism touted by Don Young aided and abetted by his fellow conservative governing cretins.  Disgusting.
This is hilarious.  Before cannibas is approved for sale, the plan to spend the proceeds is already in place.  Crazy.
"the hoi polio"  what do you have against common folk who are also paralyzed?  If you are going to be elitist and condescending you should at least try to get the language right.  The term is hoi polloi.  And it is pretty much only used by jerks.
This guy is a lunatic. Progressives have infiltrated the Catholic Church and need to be purged as they are a cancer. Bearing false witness is a sin, Padre and let he who has no sin cast the first stone, Padre...he reminds me of the Priest in Dirty Harry realizing how wrong he was after it was too late...Bishop McElroy, your willful mischaracterization of everything is shameful. Hating your neighbors (which all progressives do) is a sin. This nut job is an example of what is killing the Catholic Church...get the progressives out of here...stop promoting violence...and lawlessness...and riots...and hate...
Sadness is in order for the Trump Derangement Syndrome zombies that plague the land.  The liberal/radical snowflakes are in panic mode but they will have 16 years to grow old and probably die waiting for the Trump demise.
So why aren't the Koch brothers, Buffet, Cuban and Bloomberg, etc. not supporting Trump? Why would liar and thief HRC make a good POTUS?
You are wrong, the majority of Americans do not agree with this moronic buffoon.
Hope we never see or hear about this clown on a soccer pitch again.  Epitome of poor sportsmanship.  Even if they were "cowards," that's not something you say in postgame remarks unless you're an absolute tool.  Either way, Sweden was SMART!  There's no difference in the Olympic Tournament between a 1-0, 2-0, or 11-0 victory.  As soon as they got ahead, why wouldn't you shift to a defensive strategy?!?! Especially against a superior team like the US. And don't complain that their strategy was "boring," every aspect of soccer is boring!  Glad that NBC will shift its coverage to something more exciting like rhythmic gymnastics or equestrian dressage.
We have laws against rape and murder. Rape and Murder still happen. Get rid of laws on Rape and Murder because they don't work.  That is how dumb your argument is.
Incredible stupidity. I am astounded by the utterly moronic actions and statements made by this pair, to say nothing of the breathless story written by wapo reporters.
All these people are old and feeble. Holy crap, any kind of self defense would be appropriate. A push could knock them down and break a hip. All I'm saying, they wouldn't have got 10-18 year old me. Fight!!!
It's hard to know who's dumber. The buyers, for not checking what they were buying. Or the seller, who thought the buyer would be that dumb again.
Your an idiot
Does that include comments of the rich and powerful publicized by the media and The Globe and Mail itself: Such as TRUMP's "I want to punch that guy in the face" and "PUSSY" GRABING or Philippines Rodrigo Duterte's "SON OF A BITCH" it all seems a little hypocritical that the media promotes those people then censors those who criticize them truthfully where "quotations" should be allowed to have some legitimacy but is not.
Wow FrostedBerry, you cannot assume that someone that is opposed to Trump, for any reason, supports another candidate but by your reaction to my post it is obvious that nothing could persuade you differently.  Enjoy your ignorance.
Teachers pay taxes, too...   Fool..
As he said it was not existence the ENTIRE time. Clearly is was in use in 2011 but not in the 50's or 60's. Good try being snotty but you sounded stupid.
Bruce Scotland - I like Trump just because it means idiots like you don't.
Classic rap is one of the best things America has ever produced. Why shouldn't the Obama's have had the artists they like visit the White House? It's traditional for presidents to invite prominent artists to perform there. All this ignorant, and frankly racist, whining from commenters about rap is laughable. The cultural critique that inheres in classic rap music of the late 80's and 1990's is as relevant today as ever. Go to Europe (including eastern Europe) and hang out. Rap music, dj culture, reggae are all thriving and comprise the major cultural scene there.  "I spread the message of hope and of unity. That's what gets me up in the morning. I can tell you what is wrong, but I can't tell you how to fix it. I'm a raptivist, not a politician. I deal in hope. " Chuck D Thank God for rap music.
So.....  When you make comments such as this, you're saying one of two things.... 1) It is OK for Sessions to be a crook, but not Holder or Lynch, or 2) It is OK for Sessions to be a crook, since it was OK for Holder and Lynch...but you're only criticizing the latter.  Which version of hypocrisy do you prefer?  BTW--If HRC was/is such a crook, there's nothing stopping Session from going after her.
"I just want to get rail done no matter what the consequences are." Caldwell is dangerous and wants us to pay for his ineptness and ego. Tear it down.
Where do I vote?  Christ look at the losers who have destroyed our economy the last 50 years!  From Middle Finger to Jacques black shaleck Chretien, to Harper and now the camp counselor who doesn't even know what economy or budgets are.  This is the dream team of immigration busting, Terrorist executing,  economy rockin, and liberal jailing for pay and play.  Let's go
Yeah, the criminal element in Delta always mutters that they're going to take Alaska back. Bunch of f-tard thugs.
So that's why people voted for Trump!  Never thought that there were that many bigots, bullies, racists, sexual predators, morons, and/or brain-dead people in our country.  Chose the one that's closest to describing you, Trump supporters, they all stink to high Heaven.
*ding ding ding* we have a winner. The lunatic Maxine Waters actually said today that she opposed Trump firing Comey but would've supported Hillary doing it had she won....lol
This obsession and obstinate insistence on holding Trump to a 2015 promise that he changed in 2016 is just ludicrous.    It is inane and ludicrous to obstinately insist that Trump did not nor can not change his mind on any of his Election2016 promise.  Inane and ludicrous because, get this, Trump promised to place Clinton in jail in Election 2016 when he becomes president.
another ignorant paranoid hillbilly.
He is not going to listen to any of that in fact he is  not going to listen at all. He will hold his hand  over  chest and tell everyone  what a good job he and  his band of fools are doing. I notice he does not have the balls to go to Alberta or Saskatchewan.
just like this article - your manufacturing junk to try to legitimize this whole stupid Russian chase guarantee Obama and Clinton met with anyone who had absolutely anything negative on trump but somehow its now illegal for anyone to talk to "Russians"    Stupid and McCarthyism
So for about 230 years we have been using the electoral college which has resulted in the longest running democracy in the world, and now that liberals underestimated Hillary Clinton's negatives people are calling to scrap the electoral college?  Silly.
Mike Pence Lawyers Up  http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/pence-denies-he-knew-about-flynn-though-that-was-his-job.html  How was he to know that the candidate who invited Russia to hack the election and bragged about groping women would get into so much trouble.  He's playing dumb, but it was his job as head of the transition team to vet Flynn.  He can play dumb, but no one is buying what he's selling, so he lawyered up.  Tipped his hand when he did that.
So do bigots and racists that rear their horny heads every time a pathetic shooting, homeless, Native, or LGBT news article is posted.  Thanks, Ridgefield for proving my point.  And yeah you too, Kyle Craig.  Your trigger "like" finger must have a giant calus by now.
Amazing that morons complain that the "rich" will get all the tax breaks! almost 50% pay ZERO Federal income tax, so how the hell would they get a tax break ?
Oh look, more dick sucking fake news. Another site to block from my news feed
In other words, he's just another criminal, an extortionist.
You're not 907AK, you're just a troll.
No, Trudeau is just plain dumb. Don;t play it up you know this is true.
why are tax payers paying for these billionaires` PR tour of entitlement??  disgusting!
U R dumb. Butthead
most women have to put up with this garbage in one form or another. there's only so many times you can brush this off. after a while, it gets seriously annoying.
clearly you have no intelligence since trump is now the leader of the largest customer Canada has hence you don't burn the bridge you ignorant lib hack
Oh my goodness you're stupid.  Calling our national intelligence chiefs "goons"?  You're a shining example of a mouth-breathing Trumpite living in an utterly fact-free world.  Yeah, the intelligence services being on "the left".  That's a side-splitting laugh, pal.
Your total ignorance is simply amazing.  It is all over Drudge tonight.  I'll leave you to yourself, arguing with you is a waste of time.
If two persons want to hit each other on the head and kill each other in the process, let them do it. That will be one or two violent moron less on the planet.
Why should our hearts bleed for Putin's puppets being sent back to Siberia, Bill ?  Good riddance to bad rubbish !  Should have been done the moment that the evidence of Russian hacking first emerged if you ask me.
So Colorado made what... 3 billion dollars last year off of marijuana. Here they are fighting it tooth & nail and more worried about stealing a 1000 dollars from each of us. Step over a dollar, pick up a dime. Idiots
Time is running out for the Russian stooge Julian Assange in his cowardly hideout. Thirty days and counting. Tick ... tick ... tick ...
Keep it down, crazy.
It is not illegal to question what Jordan Peterson thinks is science, neither for nor against.  What hysterical nonsense.
Prove it or shut up.
And at no time do you ever address the facts that debunk the ridiculous nonsense you post around here. Like a coward you run from those facts to repost ridiculous nonsense that has been thoroughly debunked. It is why I say liberalism is a mental Illness.
LOL, feeble, pathetic performance? You give this guy WAY too much credit still.   I don't think he could run a water stand in the middle of a drought!
What liberal has ever said that mentally ill people are not dangerous?  Rather it is phony conservatives who have no problem with the mentally ill.  After all they elected the Donald as president, a person running on only half a spark plug.
Guard: "What is your purpose in travelling to the United States?" Foreign Agitator: "You crazy bastiches elected the wrong person and we are heading down there to spoil the inauguration and really tell you what deplorable idiots you all are." Guard: "Hm.  No thanks."
Howdy_do, do you honestly think that Trump isn't a bigot and/or a racist? Look at his history, he got in trouble for discrimination in his properties, he put Mr. "alt-right" Bannon in his cabinet. Trump is a poor quality person and yet you continue to present him as something good, your perspective and parameters for leadership are wrong.
The liar here is Bernstein,  CNN is sour grapes who can't bully this POTUS.
It is not the law I am calling predictable.  It is the fools who cling to the pre-Vatican II epistemology of Pius IX and Pius X that thinks modernity is a heresy when science challenges what they were taught in grammar school - or worse what their parents were taught.
This woman is as fake as her perpetual tan.
Mckenna is just about as annoying as Trudeau. Her arrogance and holier than thou attitude are repugnant. I didn't hear that she made the stupid comment but it's not surprising.
Boots, a wise man will change his position on various issues when presented with information he did not previously have.   Anyone who refuses to do so is a fool.  That makes trump a wise man.
You're an ass.
You mean like how China is using Trudeau as and unwitting fool.
So you agree with Charles Dickens - " the Law is an ass!"l
Merkel, the German witch-in-chief, is hiring ex Stasi to enforce what you want. Maybe you should apply.
the idea of re-engaging to do his damn job has yet to occur to Senator Rubio.
Just trying to remain relevant in a world sick of your stupid elitist lies are we Karl? Too bad the regular Americans see through your bias. Walk west until your hat floats scheisskopf!
The ugly no-chin visage of the corrupted genes.
Headline in the Montreal Gazette...Bitter rivals battle to 3-3 draw, but Leafs prevail in OT..Is that pathetic, or what?
Tragic that any South African would still regard this awful woman as leadership material.
When this woman talks about people who can't afford to leave, she really means losers.  Florida is chock full of stupid people. Those "snowbirds" who move there just because it is warm are even dumber.
while you stand for ignorance and lies, trump is cutting taxes for anyone who pays them, costs to companies and government interference in the market place making jobs come soaring back to the usa for the working tax payer while our loser justin works for china!
Ossoff just being the loser assoff he is.
We shouldn't expect anything from him. The weight of our expectations should NOT be on his shoulders. He has enough to contend with.   Stupid sports writers!
You can take the Corrupt Bastard's Club outta the LIO, but you can't take the LIO outta the Republicans.
Who cares,Hillary lost. We talking about jr. Fool be like "hillary yada yada". Stop stroking urself about hillary. Go get a Playboy mag.
Well said Roy. It occurred to me that until this mentally unstable and pathological lying buffoon came on scene in national politics recently, I had never heard the term "fake news" or "alternative facts". Just sayin'.
What a colossally idiotic comment by our PM. I'm glad this author heard it and reacted to it.
Sounds like a selfish moron to me.
You are right Jack and the Liberal government has now allowed our spending on National Defense to slip below 1% of GDP. Pathetic.
Garbage dump is the real name for mexico so if you are not liking my comments, go protest.
So long as it takes 8+ hours to fully charge the batteries at 240V and 45 minutes with a supercharger they will never replace gas vehicles.  Each 240V standard charge station takes a 40 amp breaker at 240V. Your standard house electrical panel is a 240V 100amp panel that already has a 30-40 amp breaker in it for the stove and 20 amp breaker for your Laundry dryer.   So you and your spouse come home and both plug in your 32 amp chargers to recharge the 100km you each drove that day. Then you want to cook dinner while your kids use the computers, watch TV, etc. Not to mention your HVAC (furnace, AC, HRV, etc) equipment loads. OOPS, not enough power.   And remember that the morons in power in places like Vancouver and Ontario want you to not use gas to heat your home and hot water and switch to electrical for this energy also.  You got between $4000-$10000 laying around to upgrade your home electrical service? You will need it.
As happy as you may have been to leave I assure you that many of us were positively delighted. From the insane and embarrassing effort to portray Moochelle as the most beautiful and glamorous woman in the history of the world to the hero-worship of her dim-witted husband, we were trapped in an 8 year nightmare. I hope I never have to see your angry, bitter face again. Get over yourself.
Windbag!
When the people in Minneapolis suffer because of the government overreach he prescribes to, bring the guitar back out. Better yet, take it to Seattle and start singing! What an arse...I am!
yet the same people that make silly accusations as you did never thought that when obama did the very same thing was in any way wrong! hypocrites
Your selfish ignorance is only matched by your abstract cynicism. Both bits of darkness leave you worse off and feeling disgusted about yourself and others. If it was only about money why not fund coal?
I guess nobody has let you in on the fact that Jonathon Pie is a fictitious satirical  "left wing Journalist" who illustrates the naivete of trolls like you.
Are you glad you voted for those idiots now?
Really? some boob actually pulled a shooting in front of two Fairbanks cops and didn't recognize them before pulling a stunt like that. Come on now Fairbanks isn't that big where a criminal of any intelligence wouldn't know who the police where. This is selective stupidity at its finest.
A worthless parasite like you won't understand that it takes effort and hard work to EARN money. Money that is then taxed by the government and given to trash (public unions, teachers, leftist academics and assorted third world beggars)
It's expected and what are the villagers going to do about it, NADA., it's a way of life for young idiots.
our mayor is an idiot. this runaway project will doom this state.
Well, larry, if you re-read your comment, you pretty much said that the reason millenials don't go to Church is because they think that the  Church teaches that sex is bad and millenials think sex is good.  Mind you, I don't disagree with that all that much.    My point is that the Church does NOT teach that sex is "bad."  It is those who hate the Church that report that the Church teaches that sex is bad.  So the reason that millenials don't got to Church is because some non-Church secular entity told them something that is not true.  Pathetic.
Why? It's his money! He didn't steal it from anybody! What a silly comment.
Three words - second hand smoke.  Rare are the areas where cigarette, pipe, and cigarette smokers can enjoy their (non-intoxicating) vice anymore.  The primary argument in those campaigns was that second hand smoke kills.  Lane County just outlawed tobacco smoking in the great outdoors of campgrounds. Smoke is smoke.  I hope the liberals are not that hypocritical.
"3 killed, 4 injured after CAR HITS BEAR on I-70... Read the Caps in the prior sentence.  Try to stay in your lane after hitting a 300 pound object.  That being said, what kind of idiots drive without seat belts?
Shutting down the government may play well to his base, but his base is a minority of a minority and playing well to them doesn't help the republicans, America, or the world. It only makes our mentally ill president feel good.
No one in canada is as stupid as a republican of the united states of sexual assaults and droning people for oil or some stupid company that commits fraud internationally.    Oh wait.. maybe the ones here that Harper hired  but many of them weren't  even born and raised here.
Attempting to have rational conversations with Trump or any of his supporters is a waste of time.  Trump told us who is is, and we listened.  So called "mainstream" republicans who support Trump are in league with Neo Nazis, homophobics, Russians, traitors, perverts and predators have told us who they are.  We will remember how you have revealed what absolutely disgusting people you are, and how you have lost all credibility with rational America.
Maybe he could retire there and freeze his wittle tail off while he swings through the trees..Somebody said Hussein is an idiot and I agree...
Such a loser. So much losing.
trump is scary stupid, scary ignorant, scary uneducated and scary crude.  he must really be a very insecure man... like hitler.  churchhill had his eye on hitler and the natzi party for a long time. he knew that the natzi's plan to take down england would be a goal of germany.  he really worked FDR to join and send relief.  england was broke.  the american people weren't so aware of hitler, but FDR was....an anti german move would be hard to sell as there were so many GERMAN IMMIGRANTS (how dare them emigrate here!) in the states.  how many of you all have german blood in your ethnicity?  i have some. i'm the descendant of a dirty german  immigrant! and a scottish one, and an irish one, and an english one and a danish one and some indian blood from a canadian tribe.  wonder what the donald's lineage is?
Damn with English like that you should be a slave ...no one would pay you .
Dumb and dumber.
What is it with this world that it is crazy obsessed with politics? Now I must ask my grocer as to which political party he/she supports before I buy my food? What idiocy.
Just another one of Trumpelthinskins lying cohorts!
Your argument is ridiculous, you would not go into McDonalds and demand Chinese food.
do you know the definition of an egotistical narcissist =trump
I knew there would be some backlash on Chin who file the case. He said tourism will be affected by the ban. Well it also we be affected by the Boycott. Bet your foot is in your mouth now. Trump also made some heavy cuts to our budget. So now what? Maybe not as much tourists and no fed monies. As always our political leaders and people in authority open their mouths without really thinking things through. And to think we voted for these idiots. All smoke and mirrors. Better hope that things look up and I don't mean in a few years.
Yes. It's a small group, but they are EXTREMELY whiny...  “No politician in history, and I say this with great surety, has been treated worse or more unfairly." -DJT
pencil neck, bugeye schffitshit is that STUPID?
How stupid does the Liberal Government think the people of Canada are.  Who in their right minds are going to pay $1,500.00 dollars to meet with a cabinet minister and not discuss politics or how the government can fill the pockets of his or her company.  What do you thing they discuss at these gatherings, freaking baseball scores.  Same old same old from the liberal thieves.
The health care bill the GOP just passed will take insurance away from a baby born with medical issues.  You have NO problem with the taxpayers paying for your medical issues. Hypocrite!
Truly a piece of shit.
fuck you
What kills me the most about all of this is that we are being robbed blind my a bunch of bumbling fools  of incredibly limited intellect.  If I was going to get ripped off to this extent I would at least hope it was by smart, smooth criminals employing sleight of hand techniques. Not by the laurel and hardy show of ministers who don't know what is going on in their own portfolio companies,  pa's that Get caught up in Dubai on the way back from Portugal and these gupta guys who can barely string  a sentence together. it's embarrassing
Trudeau is an idiot. Let Goodale deliver the message.
You are a pathetic narrow minded person who hides behind the American flag, probably hides behind the robes of Jesus, and live a wretched life to boot.
That Murrikkka hasn't gone anywhere. It's just got an orange buffoon at the helm now.
Wow, 214 and CDNBB are really showcasing their idiotic reactionism to the hilt. Really needs some baseless fearmongering about sharia law in Canada to be completely ridiculous, so please get on that.
Hard lesson to learn for some fools. At least there was no innocent bystanders killed or injured.
Whining about uncivil comments being deleted and not learning from your mistakes is more pathetic Duke. Get a grip.
Stupid is that stupid does. Just like a little child you tell not to touch a hot stove, some people never learn when they are told they should stay away from toxic people.
They take the dumbest people in Alaska and then ask them to do even dumber stuff.
Gail Wood - I completely agree, but only with the proviso that we shouldn't vote for either of the two major parties. The Republicans and the Democrats aren't different from one another in any substantive way. We should vote 3rd party or force the State to allow non-partisan elections at the state level. Otherwise, we're just going to swap one stupidity for another and kick the can down the road toward fixing anything.
Heh heh. Liberal heads are exploding all over. Most of the loudmouth know it alls are strangely silent today
Just another case of our broken Criminal Justice system in Alaska!    It used to be that a 'Felony' was a serious crime where the convicted was punished.  Not anymore, they are just put on probation and told to play nice and don't get caught again.  Which in this case, the Bethel complaint was a "low-priority" one and the result is a dead man and possibly his wife.  Yes, the Criminal Justice System is overloaded, understaffed and underfunded, we have heard that before.  Just like AST is understaffed and has to prioritize their resources based on "priority".  The big question is 'why'?  If the Legislature can remodel offices, buy buildings, take trips on state money, and make back room deals with boondoggles to nowhere, then perhaps their priorities are wrong?  When the Governor can take trips promoting business, spend obscene money on buddy attorneys and consultants while the people of the state deal with property crimes which are "low-priority",  perhaps the voters are just stupid!
Who cares if the fair weather fans turns thier back on the Nfl. More then Likely their team sucks anyway. The league will survive with or without those hypocrites. Our maniac President isn't helping out with his lets just kill everyone, cowboy attitude.  This country has a lot of issues and football definitely isn't our big problem. The brainwashed idiots are the problem!
While Trump and his administration continue to declare that his response to the growing humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico is going well, it is becoming apparent that it is an abject failure. After a week of Trump not even mentioning Puerto Rico, there has been another week where Trump has been just flat out lying about how everything was going great. That's a lie. But of course, Trump lies all the time, and about Puerto Rico it's more of the same, just lies. Trump has been golfing, three trips this past week, 3 of the last 3 days and more golf tomorrow. The abject failure appears to be a trifecta of Trump's utter incompetence, lack of urgency on the part of the Trump administation and the sheer magnitude of the damage. Many report that FEMA has "collapsed" on the island in terms of its ability to offer help and supplies to those most in need. Trump says: “We have done an incredible job." Sure, Donald, …if spreading cholera is doing an incredible job.
The Russia story is dead - any liberals who continue to push it will look even more foolish and idiotic than they already do.
The recent black president Obama was going to solve all of this. This man did NOTHING. He is a disgrace.
Trump is a racist, …and a petty con man, …and a traitor. But back to the racist part.   That's what attracted so many of his supporters.  There is no longer any doubt that Mueller's office is investigating Trump for collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice in the Russia investigation, …it's just a matter of time now. Being rid of the racists in the White House will go a long ways to making all the other racists scurry back under their rocks where they belong.
Trump just has a inept staff. It may be difficult to know what to say though when the boss Trump is incompetent. Sean Spicer is like Baghdad Bob. He can't keep his lies straight with the Presidents deliberate false statements. Trump is a below average President.
These scumbags need to rot in jail forever. I hope they toss them in general population butt naked with a huge jar of Vaseline. I'd like 10 minutes alone with each of the ass wipes to kick the crap out of them. Have in prison homies!!  Don't drop the soap.
Does Trudeau think the public is dumb as he is and believe he "misspoke".
I am not going to buy anything for 3 years, until the GET goes back down.  I am going to starve out these parasites!
FOX NEWS!  LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL  Only morons watch faux news.  You silly hyblerbhil
As Trump said "Ruling is hard".   Poor clown Liberals supporters who were telling the rest of us how things would be different under Trudeau..  Sure they are.
Fine idiots who need to be rescued $25k. Hippies will stop hiking to it. Need purpose in life? Get a puppy.
You people are so off the wall it pathetic how you babble on just because your thing lost the last election! It's a relief and a pleasure to finally see someone in the White House that respects and loves being there.Not like the past scum of the Clinton's and the Obama's,whom the latter just happened to shove another 10 TRILLION  DOLLARS IN NATIONAL DEBT down the throats of the American public just to push his stupid agenda.So please don't tell us how bad Trump after only 6 months in office you stupid twit Bernstein!!!!
These bottom feeders (Trumps/Republicans) are professional liars - will always be liars - it's very simple. When will the Alt-right wake up and stop supporting the con?
Today, even more than in Twain's day, you could substitute "successful crook" for idiot and be spot on.
Honolulu Hawaii, just another Democratic cesspool of cronyism and corruption !!!
Hey ,The Union Farts Forever, are you STILL crying in your beer?  Turns out Manafort was wire tapped.  Turns out the Demoraps colluded with the Russians.  Turns out Comey obstructed justice.  You are such a loser, like your defunct party, its sad it really is.  : )
We didn't, Boris. To try and deny the fact that the Russians hacked the DNC servers and interfered in the election just shows that you're willfully ignorant...or blind as a bat.
What an absolutely stupid comment. The supply of lawyers is also dictated by off shore schools. Seeing that only1 in 11 students get into a Canadian Law school when they apply what happens to the ten? Well maybe 2 or 3 give up the rest go off shore. Bond University in Australia has a complete Canadian Law school and the other kids go to the United States or Britain - then they come back and the Canadian Federation of Law Societies lets them take catch up courses and bingo they write the Bar and are lawyers. Seeing that 1/3 of the students that wrote the Bar in Ontario last year received their education off shore that means the law societies do control the amount of lawyers. Nice try though.
I'll opine that stereotyping is in the eye of the beholder, AkBorn's comments could have just as well been directed against those white trash punks in the Valley murder-oops, there's that stereotyping again:).  Seriously, I looked at this guys FB page yesterday and what's troubling as usual are some of the comments from  friends that can certainly be easily stereotyped.  What is it with this attitude that dwells on the in your face / F-bomb laden crap, the "gangsta" image most of us find despicable - especially when the wanna be turns into just that.
Jim Minnery is a liar and a charlatan. Christians should be ashamed that he associates himself with them.
All the little piggies squeal their heads-off!  Bye-Bye Kealoha's and all the money they wasted.  Mayor Clodwell is a joke.
There is a huge difference between taking the lead and foolish endeavours . Totally destroying our economy  while China does nothing is nothing short of stupid. Canada is also carbon neutral as a country. Sorry this is not my problem. Using you logic maybe we should not have children to help with global overpopulation.. Want to set an example stop the wars that contribute moe to global warming than all the cars in Canada.
Disgusting race baiting comment.
Damned homeless travellers
I normally don't comment but this idiot made me so mad I had to take the time to access several logins just to vent. Who calls out bull moose during rut only to boast about it? Now all the world gets to see this video as representative of not just Alaskans but Alaskan "avid" hunters. And he's been here six whole years. Six years. Argh...
Share the same faith with a narcissistic troll? Nah!
CE:  I'm assuming you recognize the irony of announcing you are through exchanging insults with DG with......an insult.  DG is far from an IDIOT,  she's obviously very bright.  You are far from an IDIOT, you're very bright as well.  From my perspective, I agree and disagree with DG (more agree than disagree) and the same w/you (more disagree than agree)....that's the way life is.  However, if we can pursue civil discussions, we can all benefit from the other's views and opinions.  I know this sounds a bit saccharine, but I really believe it.  Gary Crum
I'll ignore your silly straw man at the end, since that's not at all what I'm doing.  It's a common tactic some people use in discussions like this, pretending like it's "defending" when it's really pointing out hypocrisy.  England quickly forgave the US and has been a staunch ally of the US ever since.  You'll even find from statues of some of our founders there.  Plus, the southern states ARE still part of the US.  They're not some distant enemy where we have no concern for their people and their history.  Just because these states seceded for a few years doesn't mean we should pretend they aren't now and never were part of the US prior to that.  There's still a lot of Americans who consider that an important part of American history, and their family history as Americans.
They should ban all video from determining rule infractions for professional golf.  Not everybody in the field is being video recorded so it creates an unbalanced competition.  Either a rules official on site, a competitor, or the golfer themselves should be the only people to call an infraction.  In addition, the infraction should be called BEFORE the player hits their next shot.  Stupid rules makes for a stupid game.
Lee was in charge, he either knew, or was incompetent. Leaders always try to play ignorant when they are accused of war crimes, happens every time. Lee was defending the preservation and expansion of slavery, and multiple generals under his command captured free black americans and enslaved them. Thousands of free black americans were transported south during the campaign, and I will not buy for a second that Lee was innocent.   I also care little that a handful of confederate soldiers might have released a few. They were a tiny minority in an army fighting for the sole purpose of preserving and expanding slavery. Once slavery because less fashionable the south started an enormous revisionist history campaign to paint themselves as victims or noble men defending their homeland. Total garbage.
Only losers make excuses
Liberal followers of Justin seem to know or care nothing about economics. Are they all waiting for hand outs that they pay for through their taxes if indeed they actually work ? Junior worked for two years as a substitute teacher and lived off a trust fund for twenty years. Dumb and dumber eh.
Jimmy Kimmel is a left wing lunatic, only famous for making crank phone calls & getting on his knees for Odumbbell & Hitlery.  More people watch paint dry than his pathetically low rated excuse of a TV show.  Puleeeeeze.....
Shove her as* back across the border and let her have the baby in Mexico. Why do we have to put up with this crap from illegals?
Hanabusa would be a fool to give up her congressional seat to run for Governor.  She may be seriously challenged ethically but she is no dummy.  She will definitely run for either Hirono's seat if and when it becomes available  or try for Schatz's seat or just bid her time for now if Hirono runs again.  Only a total opportunist or fool would want to be governor the way things are going in our beloved Republica Bannera. In any case, being governor is just small potatoes.  The opportunity to make the big bucks and to hob nob with the rich and powerful is in Washington DC and not in some back water, and insignificant state verging on insolvency and having a host of serious problems of all sorts.
The medical term for Moore is "excrement-head."
Johnny, your comments have been well rebutted above. But let me add, as a taxpayer and a business owner who has employed dozens of disadvanted Black and Coloured township youngsters, I have every moral authority to comment, to criticize, to stand up against and condemn looting, theft, incompetence, disgraceful arrogance and stupidity. Every voice in our country under our constitution is free to speak up and be heard. Your argument is disgraceful.
Stupid👇
So while all this politicking going on, Enbridge quietly doubled their capacity in the U.S. with U.S. Government and State Government approvals. Nary a word form all the self-appointed we'll save the planet for you crowd was heard. Hypocrites all.
of course my comment was intentionally ''stupid'' to accurately reflect the stupidest situation any nation ever found itself where a US  Pretender In Chief implausibly has placed his Beavis and Butthead lookalike kids in extremely sensitive Gmt. positions. nothing further will come as any surprise no matter how unacceptable as they already have a long track record of the nastiest bad behavior ever, we can safely assume their toxic insanity will only exponentially acerbate.
wow the typical dark liberal twisted nut job post of the day, so you  can not refute the facts so its insult! ah, the mantra of the liberal, when they can not even support thier own government cause they too know how corrupt and pathetic it is..
And why wouldn't they. You support Trump policies is saying you want to exclude the vast majority of Americans from a better life. Trump and people like Pocklington support the wealthy at all cost and their policies bear this out.  Pocklington has learned nothing in old age. Still believes that if you give all the money and all the breaks to the well heeled then everything will be good for all. The problem with that is that we now have almost 5 decades of stats that say that is total crap and that under their moral guides when wealth is created it goes to a very select few and the rest pick up scraps.  When you want to keep it all for yourself then I call that a buffoon .... who wouldn't.
Funny how skewed these polls are. I pers hav NVR been polled & can guar just like w/ US fed elect, all results skewed &/or biased. Trump has a lot of supporters in Cda, incl women like myself. His stupid "off the cuff" remark about grabbing women by the p***y was a JOKE! GET OVER IT! I've heard far worse come out of men's mouths. If gen pop can't see it as jk, just proves what a lot of us ANTI SJW/feminazi's say. They're precious little snowflakes who can't tk a jk! Also applies 2 members of my own fam, all thx to MSM propagating him as sick misogynist, while promoting Killary who's husb impeached 4 having sexual relations w/ intern! Not 2 mention flew multiX, even ditching SS, on CONVICTED PEDOPHILE Jeffrey Epstein's Lolita Express. - Fr Wash Times: http://bit.ly/1Wxqzv6 Wmn came fwd & gave testimony Killary threatened them if they came fwd about rape by him. Fr Daily Wire http://bit.ly/2cQDYNI Just do a quick google search, doesn't tk much 2 #FactCheck
Eastern Europe is one of the creepier, most corrupt regions in the world. Don't trust Russians or Ukrainians. The Communist Party way back when was good in one way - corruption was limited to family members and friends of members. Now, the corruption permeates the whole societies - from top to bottom.
Are you a  Trump accountant,  work for the IRS or just full of manure?
Complete garbage.
If I passed by Buddy (Mr. Scheer) as I walked down a bus aisle ... I would not have recognized him. Good luck with that. :( I like the idea of a PM who is (probably) as smart as me ... who has the stones to defy his province's stupid dairy policy ... who can seduce and poke a gorgeous dangerous woman (as opposed to leasing one) ... and who could pound me into a pulp if I "messed" unfairly with him. Just sayin' ... Basic Canadian lumberjack mentality ...
If there was a deal, I and millions more would agree with you Reich.  The exceptions would be the terminally stupid Trump Bots and other conservatives.
"White nationalists want an all white country" And they aren't going to get it, this country has never been all white, and never will be, the whole concept is stupid, but, whatever.
What a clown. Two weeks in and he's already looking dumb.  - My bet is he doesn't make it through a full term, he'll find a way to get arrested and impeached.
Scum
Whatever happened to libel and slander laws?  Dembowski should have been sued multiple times by now.  She is proven liar.
Poor Vicki Williams, her life is miserable because the paper comes in one section.
Wow.  The civil gestapo deleted my comment regarding your poor grammar skills after you questioned my education.  Pathetic.  Truly pathetic ADN.
This comment here is so ridiculous and literally anyone who knows him could tell you that. These bullies have been targeting him for months because of his placement and they have frequently set him up to be blamed for things as a way to intimidate him. These kids targeted a kid with special needs and harrassed him relentlesly for weeks after months of more passive aggression. You calling the victim a bully is proof the apple doesnt fall far from the tree. Anyone with logic can tell you one kid with crippling anxiety is not bullying a group of popular edge lords. Good luck with that.
Trump "won" in a rigged election and is not accepted as legitimate by many of us.  He is so ignorant and anti-American it is embarrassing.
They are doing the right think for the National Donkey and Hawaii donkey committees.  They may be good people, but, are blinded by the brainwashing of the Donkey Party to the detriment of the whole.
None of which you state is funny.  Did your brain stop developing at age 12?
Its Sussex Dr. you idiot and Harper lived prior to the election.
Putin's PuppetS.....
Is anyone that stupid to think if he moves the press/propaganda room to a different location the American public will be left in the dark wondering what is going on in our capital. My goodness he can be invading countries and issuing executive orders that affect so many and we will never know will we? We have our State Capital far from the population(which is a huge waste) and it is just as dysfunctional as it would be in Anchorage. Due to liberal so called "unbiased" news agencies such as ADN and the failing Washington Post spewing so many one sided stories I can understand why he does not like the press. They are now reaping what they sowed, deal with it. They are now being punished for their actions and should be. I expect no less from PE Trump. Liberals overall are now reaping( and weeping) what they have sowed by cramming their agenda down Americas throat to the point of America wanting a big change. We'll , big change has already started and its going to get bigger and better.
Woman that are bent on condemning the male gender are usually bitter disgruntled vile trollips who are bent on vitriol and guile. Case in point..... Payrollgirl
Blame all the stupid s**t on Leftist insanity and Republican cowardice to confront and defeat all the stupid s**t.
That's ridiculous  You are free to be a jerk, you are also free to go to jail.
The left calls for Trump to be assassinated, to blow up the White House, say that Trump is Hitlerian, a racist, sexist, homophobic, idiotic con man.  Trump says Crazy Bernie, Crooked Hillary, Low IQ Mika, Psycho Joe, Low energy Jeb, Elizabeth Pocohantas, Lyin Ted. He insults and they insult. There is no indication in the above insults that he treats women any differently.
What else would you expect from miniature human & racist southern troglodyte Sessions? He's a 1st class racist, KKK lap-dog, Trumpanzee and massive coward. I' sure he spends half his paid time sucking on Dondi's appendage & his back door. This gang of filth is ruining this once-great nation...racism, white supremacy, hate, bigotry, lies & bleached-hair orange homos, the gang is repulsive & pathetic. I hope they all are tortured & lynched in public. Hang 'em high!
You are using multiple accounts to harass me. You contribute nothing to the discussion. You sir, are the troll.  Grey decal, space, and a period.....you must be running out of AK907 clone accounts to harass me with.
If you're stupid enough to take your computer to Best Buy for repair it just might end up with data on it that the owner did not put there.
Another bull crap "news" story
I haven't been back home in Anchorage in six months, but after driving through midtown a couple days ago, I am shocked on how many homeless people and garbage is around. I've never seen it look so bad, ever. The mayor and city council have failed the citizens and should be held accountable. Midtown looks like a dump with drunk people in the streets. We had to wait while a bunch of them stumbled in and around the roads. Vote them out. What an embarrassment!
He must really take us all for suckers.
Lol what kind of loser likes his own comment.  Doofus
No it's not. What a stupid article. These statues only serve to glorify the confederate mythology and embolden secessionists and racist malcontents. There is nothing educational in the vast majority of these statues. None memorializes the tragedy of the US Civil war, and speaks to reconciliation required to move on and get past this sad part of America's history. Shame on you.
Leyton was an extremely smart man! We as kids worked for the Laybourns. Leyton was always respectful to his father..Stan Laybourne was a drunk and shifty man..I hope he rots in prison..that's where assholes deserve to be. R.I.P Leyton! You WILL be missed..
this is garbage...
I wonder if Nick believes Hollywood needs more real folks like the Brown clan who make Alaskan look like a gathering of misfits?
Silly.    Put some data behind your claims.   Or just let your CH4 innuendo waft untethered to facts, your call.
It would be naive, not to say ridiculous, to expect a party that was found to have cheated in the three federal elections preceding 2015 to run a straight leadership vote.  Wasn't it someone in the Harper camp who once said that rules are for suckers and losers?
Where's the outrage,  klastri, homer, keaukaha, boots, allie, cellodad, all registered sex offenders? That's how the Democrats roll. Hypocrites, liars, Bigots, racist, sexists, LOL
Uneducated individuals, when losing an argument, choose to attack having an education. People like you aren't ruling this world, people like you are working for me. You are the hooker - cause that's where having an education will lead you.
Wtf are you talking about dragoninwater?  How does your response at all relate to what I posted?  Like your hero trump, your response to criticism seems to be an ignorant attack designed to change the subject.  Btw, coherent english might help you sound more intelligent.
' Trump is a buffoon.  A traitorous and treasonous belligerent child.  There's nothing to like. .
In our parliamentary system we elect Members, not parties. Floor crossing is part of our system.  Let's compare your view and mine:  Here in Alberta, Jason Kenney is running for the PC leadership on a platform of collapsing 2 parties and moving everyone over to a merged conservative-not-centrist-like-the-PCs party. Details of his plan are sketchy at this point, but all versions of the Kenney plan require many Alberta MLAs to switch parties.  So Layla4, in your view should the entire Wild Rose and PC contingents in the Alberta Legislature stand down for by-elections when that happens??? Or would you argue that voters don't require consultation in that case? (and why not?)  BTW Jason Kenney used to be very vocal, expressing opinions similar to your own. Fortunately for Kenney, hypocrisy is part of his life condition.
Stupid people voting with their pocket books, I mean, what were they thinking?
As a "card-carrying" liberal, I strongly support the First Amendment Right to freedom of expression.  If the circumstances and actions cited in this lawsuit are confirmed, the City, in my opinion. violated Mr. Cosby's freedom of expression rights by retaliating against him for exercising them.    First a disclaimer: my comments which follow are based on the validity of the claims in the lawsuitl   That said, some posters have commented that the City's alleged action was "stupid."  I think those folks are being too kind.  I consider it either "very stupid" or "very, very stupid."  One would think that somewhere in the group of individuals involved in the decision and action there would have been at least one person with the good judgment to say "Hey, people, this is a really, really bad idea...we shouldn't be retaliating against this guy for exercising his constitutionally protected rights."    In my opinion, the City's only defense can be "it didn't happen." Otherwise, time to pay up..
You are correct! Must of had brain fart! My grandchildren go to a school in the valley and that is all Hawaiian Homes Land. They would be foolish to expose themselves to the liability!
Dear Dejain (and Motley Fool), it takes 3 years and a TON of due process for a Tax Lien to appear on your credit report, I worked in credit for a number of years and have seen hundreds of cases such as this. 3 years is the waiting period for the State to foreclose for a Tax Lien and only at that time can they submit a late pay onto your credit report, they do not operate like the credit card companies and submit monthly. You (and Fool) are not as knowledgeable as you think you are.
I would agree, its such a shame we have fools like guantanamo who live in complete denial. Even after hundreds have been killed at gun point he continues to state fear is for the foolish. No go zones, high crime rates, barbaric terrorist acts are all  completely over exaggerated.  Yes tools of the radical right wing who are essentially just a bunch of  uneducated, racist xenophobic nuts !!! Truly Le Pen cant come fast enough.
You can't fix stupid.
What's really funny to me is when someone is too stupid to understand that they don't understand what they think they understand.  The Denver Post is a privately held, commercial enterprise.  They can shut you and your comments down any time they want.  You voluntarily participate in their forums, and thus subject yourself to their rules of conduct.  Your only recourse if you don't like it is to move along.  Hint...
You are doomed because you are a crude POS and ignorant as can be.
Leave it to Rhymer to argue up is really down and right is really wrong.  Faux News is beyond yellow hackery yet Rhymer is going to argue they are on the up and up, that Faux News is unbiased and ethical.  His delusions run the gamut.  As to Trump?    Trump has not one redeeming quality beyond serving as the most glaring example of what a human being should never ever aspire to.  Trump is a traitorous petty con man and a sick buffoon.  Trump is universally reviled because he earned it through his own willful mentally unbalanced derangement.
Ridiculous. If they can put a bomb in a laptop, they can trigger it in the cargo hold remotely or on a timer. This is just more inconvenience with no added security.
yes a 32% increase in labour costs is going to kill alot of jobs you ignorant fool
That's when most cowards operate.
Ever heard of,Russia,Mexico,Syria ? What a ridiculous statement !
And given at least a two year probation, complete with random UAs and mandated counseling for liars.
Trump does not have the power, it's all pandering for his feeble-minded base.
these women complain AFTER they have had sex with this clown. They got paid with success making them prostitutes.
Ridiculous!
Dumb decision.
Tough!  Maybe criminals should think before they do something stupid.  Their problem shouldn't infect any residential neighborhood.
Trump wasn’t Secretary of State and violated rules and then lied about them, give me a break. Quit making excuses about Clinton terrible behavior, it makes you look foolish.
All representatives should be on his side.  Mayor Hand-job is an idiot and needs to be thrown in jail for ignoring the law.
My home town.  So pathetic. Can't stand Eugene anymore....filthy rich build castles in south hills, buy their season tickets, while the rest of the city rots.  Self-righteous wealth that is, literally, above doing anything for the struggling masses below.  Sickening
You're a miserable little thing, aren't you? Let me guess: white male. Beardy. Prrrrrobably MRA.  How close am I?
Well, Justin thinks that the budget will balance itself, so I guess the country will run itself as well.  The attitude of the privileged class that people were stupid enough to elect as PM.
Heck, Rex is going to be too busy kissing Putin's ass to worry about Alaska....
This whole kneeling thing as shown us that free speech gives one the right to be stupid.  It has also displayed yet another example of how the bullying progressive mob infects everything with their ugliness.  What was this latest protest about?  Same as the previous ones.  America sucks so progressives need to fix it.
Does Trudeau think we are all stupid?  This man is beyond delusional.
Of course he wasn't legitimate because he was black. Isn't that your point. You racist fucking asshole?
price had already proven he was a crook through trading stocks on which he had a congressional impact  but the Rs in the Senate were too busy kissing Trump's fat behind to acknowledge that he was nominating a collection of pimps '
Whereas Trump isn't known by all as a pathological liar. Right?    You can't fix stupid.
The dimwits say that Hillary Clinton leaked classified documents.  She did not. Not one. Not one single classified document.  Hillary is a US citizen and former Secretary of State.  WikiLeaks leaks classified documents daily, in defiance of US and international law.  WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is not a US citizen, and lives under diplomatic asylum in the Ecuador embassy in London.  If you support him, you support a subversive wanted by the FBI and CIA.  Assange supports the overthrow of the US Government.  But the dimwits don't know this, and they don't care.  The dimwits shout, "Down with the USA!"
Hi Cassie, the idiot is making your job a lot tougher.
Stop talking about this trash. Next you will b devoting columns to the Kardashians. It is garbage. Ignore it & keep it out of our news(?)paper.
Finally, someone who "tells it like it is". We all enjoy the benefits of a healthy oil industry, yet some of us continue to act as if the very mention of the "oilsands" is a dirty word.  It must be nice to be rich enough to always take the "high road" when it comes to industrial development, but even the rich enjoy the fruits of said development. If you really want to "save the planet" get rid of your cell phones, computers and TV's, as well as your vehicles and just about everything else modern society provides. And that includes your vacations to places like Mexico, or anywhere that is not within either walking or cycling distance. Otherwise, stop being such  a hypocrite, and allow the rest of us to make a living.
Some people are not content just being stupid, so they're compelled to broadcast it on social media.
Not an answer.  Fact is the Donald has barely been president and already his aministration is loaded with corruption.  He sure drained the swamp.  He actually made it 10 times bigger and filled it with slime.  Disgusting.  Hillary wasn't my choice but I think she would have handled the recent disasters a lot better.  Why are republican presidents so bad when it comes to helping disaster zones?  Its because republicans just hate their jobs.
This is an important revelation that unmasks the rabid tribalism of contemporary politics.   Two guys who are essentially the same, just wearing different shirts are rabidly hated by the supporters of the other side, and adored by their supporters - for the same damn reasons.  It all comes down to hyper-partisan tribal BS. "He doesn't wear the same colour shirt as me, so he's scum!"   Hyper-partisanship is ruining what is left of our democracy, and is largely responsible for electing two completely unfit leaders in Trudeau and Trump.
Nope.  SS tax is only paid on the first 118,500 in earnings, which isn't enough to spit at for the liberal elites.  Wrong again on the other taxes.  Normal people think that things like booze and lotto aren't necessities, but luxuries and thus should be taxed at higher rates.  Guess what?  Being rich is a luxury too, comrade.  If you don't want to pay the taxes, don't make the income.  But since overall taxes are regressive, we both know it doesn't work this way.  Tax the rich bastards!
It seems like all of Hawaii with the exception of the Union's seemed to vote against RUSTY THE HATED SCREECHING RAIL . Toby must be smoking the local medical laced with dumb & dumber if he thinks extending the tax indefinitely is a good thing . As far as Caldwell's threats of using the property taxes to pay for RAIL CONSTRUCTON AND MAINTANANCE--- Not ging to happen &  I think even those in he Union's would agree.  The reality is Caldwell must go and the sooner the better. We should either Impeach/fire or just plan throw tomatoes at him every time we see him tell he resigns. Just the thought of a rotten tomato smacking his forehead makes me feel good How about you!!!!!!!
These are not "assault rifles".  Assault rifles are automatic, not semi-automatic.  This guy is showing his ignorance and leftist "university" ideology.  If the good Doctor actually said such nonsense, his name should be withdrawn immediately. There is nothing logical or "common sense" about restricting the rights of law abiding citizens who are qualified under the law from obtaining or using "semi-automatic" weapons.  They have been available for about 60 years and are useful for hunting and self defense.  If they were banned, only law abiding citizens would be stripped from their God given right of self defense against criminals and terrorists, who don't give a rat's as_ about laws.  Duh! This mis-guided individual is not thinking clearly and has no business interjecting himself into a political debate of such an important right.
Jesus, what the hell does the Donald think the Mayor should have done?  I think GW called for calm after 9/11.  What else is a leader to do?  The Donald should just go back to playing golf.  Hopefully that will prevent him from making any further idiotic statements.
Make it possible to report distracted and speeding drivers. I see them everyday, and the more cars that are on the road, the faster the speeders go.  Idiots.   I see very few patrol cars on the roads these days, while speeders and texters run free.
Your lack of intelligence shows, you must be college educated beyond your intelligence Spelling isn't everything, people like YU suck
No it's  not. I deal with multiple accounts all the time. What is pathetic is that you freak out about it. I hope your balls are in a knot.
Trumpers are all racists uneducated dooms day fearing inbreds
Leftists are only open and tolerant if your views concur with theirs.The slightest right of centre opinion and,wham,you're a bigot,racist,xenophobe,islamophobe or a white nationalist.Free speech,Canada?Not anymore.
I think we should retaliate on our local Congressmen if we are attacked by North Korea because they allowed a narcissistic sociopath to start a war.
Never post things like this on FB. How stupid can people be.
Perhaps not everyone is as grotesquely course as you!
Yep, and the reason I carry concealed. If you anti-gunners would turn anti-bad guy would sure be a help. Pretending that victims of crime prove the self protection is not needed is incredibly ignorant.
and the left winger proves yet again that the left is arrogant insulting trash with that post. no debate on any issue of reality though as usual, why? cause the left has no issue they can win on
What a load of Crap ! One does not have to belong to the ruling Party, to speak to other Governments, or be sympathetic towards certain people on the African Continent, HE IS AFRICAN ! As for Whites looking down on Black Governments ? the present Circus in South Africa today is a case in point. OUR Politics are separated by many hundreds of years from those of Blacks, Blacks do not understand Politics, to them it's like Tribalism, a feeding frenzy on it's "Colonial" wealth, different type than their white counter parts. All these African Countries completely fell apart upon the departure of the whites who brought much Knowledge and development to the Whole Continent. Most Africans hate "Colonialism" but ALL want and LIVE with ALL it's benefits, all things modern was brought by the "Colonialists" and Africa is living it ,whether they  want to admit  it or not. African arrogance knows no bounds, they ALL so want to be all things white, but cannot, therefore the hate !
Yep, the Russians are laughing all right......at the incompetent clown in the WH and the minority of voters who fell for his con man scheme.
Diana Fyffe I know this is you pretending to be your former prostitute Chanda Lovett from your illegal prostitution ring you ran from your Duben Street apartment.  Stop making fake profiles to harass me with.  You are petty and your harassment is illegal and stalking, which is domestic violence.  Your rants are false and you couldn't be more incorrect.
Instead of "pilgrim", how about "selfish and incredibly stupid idiot"? His first duty was to his seven month pregnant wife.   "Venturing into lawless areas like they did is just asking for trouble". And when you ask for trouble, you usually get it. That woman and those poor children have paid a very high price for his decisions.
The daily laziness of the Corporate Media "journalists" jumping on the Trump bandwagon for glaring headlines and minimal content repeating previous regurgitations.  3 "journalists" for one item?  No one else in or out of government gets the giant, black headlines of this declared traitor to all human rights.
The stupid-whistle on the Trump train never stops blowing, does it?  His handlers really should lock him up in a basement.  Trump isn't fit to order a pizza, let alone conduct US diplomacy.
Why do you think the truth is racist? Do you need me to say you are closer to God than me because you are white? Or do you just want your 1950's white privilege back? Facts are not kind to white bigots and the lies they tell themselves about themselves. That is not my fault. Of course, you are free to believe what ever nonsense you want. I have no use for the lies you tell yourself to feel good about yourself. That is your problem, not mine.
hopefully ignorant left wing sheep like you will be ignored, since PR in elections does not work, carbon taxes are already bs and increasing means more damage to the economy,  affordable housing is another word for freebees for the lazy,, NO THANKS
Welcome to the alternate universe of current  US political scene.   It is like watching a crude rap song from the 90's.  The only thing Clapper and  his globalist posse seem to be capable of, is clapping their half exposed buttocks and uttering rubbish from the other end.  The emperor (establishment) is half clad with half-truths.   US politics has become an utter joke.
When he saw Trump's new order Judge Watson probably thought "you can put lipstick on a pig it's still a pig" before halting it. Just my educated guess.
Every time this man opens his mouth or rants on his tweets, you realize that "you can't fix STUPID".
Racist jerk.
I know you liberals hate being labeled a Gerber or Gerbered, but duped is duped and perhaps better then being labeled as mindless trolls for Crooked Hillary. Secondly [as stated before] I'm an independent, also a Red Cross volunteer for the last 20 years who actual deployed to Haiti in mid-February 2010 for 7 months. At least I have the great pleasure of knowing far more of the Haitian truth vs. the liberal that sits on their hind end spewing mindless ignorant C***.
Speaking of dumb, where did I knock knock Radcliffe for losing in the national championship game? I only pointed out that the Ducks have had trouble matching up, physically strong opponents and used Ohio State as an example. There were many reasons for the lose to Ohio State including the depletion of the receiving corps to injuries. Recall that the Ducks also had All American Hroniss Grasu hobbled by injury.
I find many comments on this site Funny when you are attacking liberals. I'm a liberal and I beleive we should send all of these people to Nennana and Fairbanks so they can be with the Conservatives that keep voting in the same idiots that are creating the swinging door in our prisons.
your left wing stupidity is uncivil
Rubber combusts spontaneously. Every educated person knows this. The smaller the rubber particles and the larger their surface area, the more prone they are to spontaneous combustion. These rubber "granules" are lying in a pile. This is an invitation to spontaneous combustion. We all want to blame "kids" but likely, this is the result of ignorant persons storing a highly combustible material without regard to safety. My advice is to get the geniuses responsible for this situation to spread the granules on the track, right away.  Good grief! The stupidity! The abysmal ignorance!
Trump is the lyingest liar, even among politicians, and that's really saying something.
ha ha the left wing troll of stupid yet again, see loser the sinking ship from the polls are already the NDP in alberta, and the libs in ontario and with justin! ,, you lunatics are the infestation we are starting to rid canada of
It's still true that Justin has all of his father's arrogance and none of his brains.  He believes his polling numbers against parties with no leaders mean he can get away with anything.  I have to admit to being wrong about Justin being the dumbest Liberal. Churlish is coming on strong.
Kasich the clown. !Jeb! Light in the loafers Lindsay  Romulus Romney  All losers. Run and spend other people's money.  Ego boost for them even when they are rejected.  Must be sad and depressing to be them and keep desperately attempting to remain relevant.
hey ignorant one, the RIGHT was split between 2 versions of the RIGHT!,, now it is going to merge and thus the ndp are going down in flames!..  get over it and prepare your resume! the left are about to be out of a job!
Does the taxpayer cover the cost of this "fix" for stupidity? That is not where I want my dollars to go. While we are looking at stupidity how about no longer covering medical costs of tobacco or illegal drug users.
This kind of nonsense is why no one is even listening the left any more. I'm surprised you didn't bring back, pushing grandma over the cliff.
The US suffers from this man's complete lack of a moral or ethical compass. This kind of stupid bald-faced lie highlights his incompetence. His people cannot persuade him to be anything but arrogant. It is only a matter of time.  The only  question is how many of his administration will get sucked into the whorl of humiliation that the inevitable impeachment will bring.
What a bunch of crooks. Typical Quebec politics, not to mention the Liberals, with a Trudeau at the helm!
Stupidty at its best Unbelievble
Indecent Proposal is more like it:  You can't see farther than your nose.  Alan, drivers ALREADY pay tolls to drive on ALL the streets of Hawaii in the form of car-specific taxes (property taxes, sales tax, gas tax, licensing, etc) as well as the vehicle purchas price, maintenance , depreciation and gas AND the cost of subsidizing your bus ride).  Do YOU want to be double-taxed, too?!?   A simple 'Thank You' would suffice instead of your Socialist drivel that everybody owes you a free ride.  I think that, to be, fair, as a consumer and bus rider you would also have to pay tolls even when you ride the bus on those roads or receive groceries or other services that were delivered over those roads.    Your histrionics about "worshipping highways" (really, you think commuters actually love a necessary evil?!?). Do you 'worship' Global Warming because you use coal-fired HECO electricity?!  Please stop being a hypocrite.
Most people in the world aren't as foolish as Trump voters.   European leaders certainly are not.
I was really surprised to read this one. Still, it's pretty clear that their Idiot-in-Chief needs to start a war to keep himself in power, and he can't realistically attack Korea.  Another oil war might be just the ticket-the 'Merikans will be right behind that.
Uhm, you mean vote for the man who doesn't pay any income tax and calls those of us who do 'suckers'?
A bullet between his eyes would more than take care of this scum.
Yeah, Butts' sock-puppet, Trudeau.
Do it, but expect one of those stupid judges to override it saying it's a violation of some kind of Constitutional Right to carry laptops.  These Bozo Judges don't have any intel on the dangers this country faces and they're putting up roadblocks in front of the person who does...The President.  There should be a law that holds them personally responsible if an attack should occur due to their wrong headed decisions.  They will miraculously begin to base their rulings on the law.
If the NDP had brains, they'd be Liberal.
I encourage this behavior. Makes the Left look like hypocrites and sore losers and wastes $7m of their money they will no longer have for other progressive causes.
they do these things called investigations, you should google it.....moron
W:  You are truly pathetic.  What, 10 comments on this board.  Get a life.  Also, if you want to talk history, remember your own.  The leafs have done  nothing for over 50 years.  Now, back to bed, the adults are talking.
This guy needs advice from Dr.Mika and Psycho Joe. on how to deal with the trump derangement syndrome, now commonly manifested by sore losers...
Windbag!
Why?  He would be stopping a person that would maybe enter your house next.  Get a clue.  He would be eliminating scum and making the planet a better place.
Exactly. No, I was definitely not calling you stupid.
That should show the fags a thing or two
" new board members holding more diverse views" is just GOP speak for gormless idiots who donated to the party.
While Trump continues to rightfully condemn the violence from both sides, the Dems/Media continue to ignore the radical left's violent Antifa anarchist groups, pretending they are insignificant.  I applaud the President for his consistency, something the hypocritical Dems/Media are sorely lacking.
My god Some people want to live outside???? You are obviously a public sector gravy train worker or bureaucrats.  Positive attitudes don't feed the poor my friend Jobs do. Veteran supports that are due to them. In Halifax I walked around downtown today. In 10 square blocks I walked 30 homeless out of 72 were vets. They did not want to live outside you jerk
TSA and HS full of stupid uneducated idiots. Can't even detect explosive residues at all. But good at groping female body parts and stealing Rolex watches. Try this. Take the laptop battery off and give the traveler a fire suppressant bag to carry it in their carry-on along with all their camera batteries and cell phones. Ban all aerosols period and re-allow scissors so we can help the stewardesses fight the terrorists ourselves. Oh yeah, those duty free alcohol and the little whiskey bottles the stewardesses serve along with soda pop. Is anybody aware they are flammable and make good improvised Molotov cocktails?
Just saying.  Yes we had deficits during the Obama years but let me remind you we had the worst economic crisis since the great depression which started in the GW years.  There were reasons for the deficits.  Now the idiot is going to expand the deficits and for what?  Poor little rich folk won't have to pay taxes as much.  You don't have to be a genius to see where this will head.  Fortunately, the Donald probably will fail once again.  One can always hope.
The focus of criticism here should not be that the BC Green Party sought moderate (at least in the BC context) donations from a couple of corporations.  The real concern is that they did so while centering their appeal to the voters in significant part on assertions that the BC Liberals and the NDP sought donations from corporate and labour organizations while the Green Party did not.  This is hypocrisy on the Green's part and the fact that the amounts involved were relatively few and small does not make it less hypocritical.
That's a crock too.
What  did  racist  liar  Bath  House  Barry  ever  do  for  any  white  people  other  than  his  rich  white  contributors?  Nothing.
I see. So, being a bigot means there are good times to be a bigot and bad times? Sorry, d*ck, you're just a BIGOT
Democrats had NO budget for 7 years, and you morons criticize this one? It's the best budget we have had in nearly a decade simply because it exists. Stupid propagandists.
Same old crap - different flies!
Dumb idea and quite hypocritical.  Yes Cuba is a repressive regime, but so are many other regimes such as China, Saudi Arabia, Russia etc. who the US trades with and doesn't have such restrictions.  Ultimately more trade means higher standards of living for the Cuban people and as their standards of living rise, there will be greater demands for more freedom.  Democracy is something that comes from within not from the outside.
New York, and ESP NYC, is run by criminals and the insane.
Indeed. Help us "take the community back" by posting pictures of this scumbag so his failed parents can see what a total disservice they did to him and "the community." If they have any honor they will kill themselves too and eradicate the earth of their junk DNA.
Just another right-wing cornflake qtip piece o' wonder bread know-nothing white trailer trash meth freak talk. That's all, no intelligence, just the result of swallowing Trump's baby batter, day in day out.
On the IRAN, NAFTA, OBAMACARE, DYNK, Puerto Rico, NFL, Las Vegas killings and every other Policy Portfolio that dTrump has a finger in it proves to anyone with an IQ over 20 that  without doubt that he is a MORONIC , DEMENTED and DEPRAVED IMBECILE who needs to be removed from the WH by any means possible ASAP before his hourly brain farts further effect climate change and/or kill every single Americans' brain cells and cause more than the incredulous damage he has already generated!   Pity poor 'Mellania and Ivaanka'....likely sex slaves or even worse . dTrump0 could not be trusted to run a children's lemonade stand in the middle of Yellowstone Park's Volcano if there were  any females within afew  hundred miles of it.  WAKE UP AMERICA...you have a sheer, total and utter BULLY-BABY IDIOT for a 'prez'. You elected what amounts to BOZO the Clown......and once upon a time the World thought that the USA had at least  modicum of intelligence? Those days are long gone since Nov 2017.
because half are educated realist that see the scam of carbon taxes for what they are!,, who as they get older will enjoy the fruits of this reality why ignorant kookaid drinkers like you would have us live with less and be worse off
I heard some lady named Hillary was writing 3-4 letters a day to the Owners, suggesting the name be changed to: "Mr. Stupid-Doody Head Dream-Crusher Tower"
You are a fool... for Holland to cost us $23m in incentives it means he performs as an all star last year which he did and he exercises his contract and gets paid another $2m in incentives next year.    Hey why didn't those cheap Montfort Rockies trade for Verlander? That's the usual drivel you usually spout... or regale us with how the monforts are stealing our money!
Just to show how ignorant Emperor Trumpo the Magnificent really is... He doesn't know that Congress cannot bring another Reconciliation bill during this year. Rules only allow 1 Recon bill per year. SAD.
Dershowitz is a scumbag who was a vocal supporter torture under the Bush administration.  His ethics are whatever suits his fancy from time to time.  A dangerously self-serving morality is at work in this man.
Bernstein says the media needs "a different kind of reporting"?...really?? You already have it...the media has called him a pig, disgusting, a thug, a goon, a liar as well as mentally ill Please Mr. Bernstein show us where any other president was called these hateful words?...it is a different kind of reporting.  I have absolutely no problem with President Trump fighting back against the media when all you hear day in and day out is this kind of reporting
What the heck s going on!?!?!   This can't al be some coincidence or harmless act of naivety anymore.  No other campaigns from any country or party have ever done this.  These people are quite likely traitors!
The congress might as well cancel the August break since our coward of a senator Corey Gardner refuses to meet the great people of Colorado anyway. He should probably just stay in DC and hangout with the Kochs, Heritage Foundation, and the Alt-Right media.
Windbag!
Here's a better Q: What in God's name is going on inside the mind of drivers who "cross over" smack in2 opposing traffic? This isn't something that occurs in milliseconds. If you were 2 deliberately cross over, it'd still take 2 seconds 2 occur unless you deliberately made as sharp an angle as possible. But "drifting" or "crossing" by accident surely takes 2 or 3 seconds IF the median is wide like on 470 -- enough time for the idiot driver to correct this unless they are unconscious or having a stroke/heart attack. I doubt most of these cases are sudden-onset medical episodes like seizures. So what is WRONG with these fools? What does it take to realize you just drifted over--the head-on collision? Can't they SEE their vehicle is drifting over & correct this in time? Or is their brain so defective that they can't process the situation fast enough? Or are 100 percent of these idiots in a deep sleep or drunk? I've driven while drowsy and NEVER drifted. Never been drunk, either.
This dude is a total phony.  He does know how to play on the hatred and biases of poorly educated white people though.  Give him credit:  he is a funny entertainer.
See jsaturn's reply to your infantile troll post.
"Evil" is a most appropriate word for  Trump. He brags that doesn't read books, and shuns reports. He  does not need to because, he "just knows." That is called omniscience. It is associated with Gods. In this case, an evil orange God.
The real sad truth is there are a lot of ignorant Americans that will listen to this clowns lies and conspiracies (and everything is a conspiracy) and accept it as truth.
Haaaaaaaaaaaaa, never surrender! Huh Klastri! Talking about pile of garbage,did you hear  Obama seizing the moment at the UN to raise money.Yes MONEY! Let's not forget that infamous air force one ordeal,where Obama  got caught chasing female reporters with his deadly weapon....you gave him a free pass then,why is that?   Today we see him hanging out with the elites,where before he used to criticize them,only to become a "Fat Cat " himself ? Oh yes! I agree "Worthless in every way". Here's a poll for you; Which president ,Obama or Trump, created more jobs in their first six month in office ? In the meantime ,let me play the Jeopardy song for you. haaaaaaaaaaaa! Imua!
You are proof that Liberals are mentally deranged and don't exist in reality.
Just draining the swamp of the scum....
If it wouldn't have happened, sooner or later this ignorant chump would have killed somebody!! Carrying a handgun at that age when you can't purchase one legally yet is stupid. This kid showed what kind of ignorant moron he was/is on his instagram. Idolizing the fake thug life that he was trying to be. Check his instagram drew_225boi.
I didn’t vote for Trump or Hillary as both are foul people. One cannot, however, consider a vote for Hillary as sane or a vote for Trump as insane.
yes and a wise politician will do exactly that at the same time maybe Alaskans will benefit from no knee jerking by the fools they may have been!
tRump is SO STUPID, he doesn't know how to spell 'unprecedented.'
Uh, your dimwit caused it.
maybe not. i voted Obama twice even donated to him in 2008 and have a t-shirt to prove it. I am an open minded guy who votes what i think will be for the best. I have been unhappy with Obama's job creation and want to try a different approach.  I do not think the entire left is filled with idiots nor do i think every liberal/progressive is an idiot but I do think the post election hysteria is idiotic. The foot soldiers are mostly idiots being led on by those who stand to make money off it like Michael Moore.
Disgusting. If a regular taxpaying American were to do what he did, they would never had made it aboard the plane. They'd still be at LAX getting everyone of their cavities checked.
Idiots
the biggest issue is that Republicans want this idiot to hang the Klu Klux Klan flag on there front lawn of the white house and Donald " Duck "Trump  is there man.  My biggest worry is that innocent americans from other races will be targeted by racist bigots which have been hiding under the radar of the FBI and CIA umbrella  like the national Front. White arena nation group Hells Angels etc,  when will the republican learn that they have a real lose cannon for a President and but the boot to him before the reputation of the party is tarnished for ever and while be for a long time to come under Donald "Duck" Trump shame they have not noticed that he has lost his marbles he is a total nut bar and he will drag the Republicans down with his sinking ship.
Gorka - easily the most repulsive of the Trump brownshirts.
It's quite maddening that our lawmakers are so damn inept, that they put their personal beliefs ahead of doing the right thing for our State. If there is a shutdown, it would prove that we have a bunch of self serving idiots running our state, and should immediately have their pay and benefits suspended.
I find it quite hypocritical that in the same letter it is suggested that the Prime Minister's primary role is to protect the health and safety of citizens while at the same time argues the merits of crippling of one of the primary economic contributors in Canada. I fail to understand how people feel we can on the one hand have health and safety and on the other a stranglehold of our country's primary industries.
another lying testimony by dump's relative.  he stated that he was naïve and very busy to know any better.  that is bullshit, he knew what the hell he was doing - colluding with the Russians.
what's remarkable about that is several polls have shown Fox 'News' viewers to be less informed than people who don't watch any news whatsoever. so the 'Fair' must refer to some sort of carnival, and 'Balanced' would then be the teeter totter between ignorance and stupidity: there you have it folks Fox News is a Carnival for Idiots😂
here is the stupidest man on the planet, and his puppet, eh Butts. $#@! up Ontario and a national disgrace as well. Admit it, you are an idiot, proved it in Ontario under lying Dalton and just moved to the National stage.
You are brain dead.  Numbers? Look at the debt: doubled from this egghead. He is owned by Wall Street and the bankers. "I'll fool them".  His words. Lied on health care. Our costs up 200%.  Your on that fraud called PERS with a 75 Billion unfunded liability.  YOU are delusional/
Politics is just a circle, you go far enough on the right and far enough on the left and you end up in the same place...........at the bottom where you find all the scum.
"meet some of the most disgusting people on Earth this weekend. On TV. But you should be aware that these disgusting people are among the most powerful in the United States. "  College and university life is another important area where Canadians are superior to their U.S. cousins, from collegiate sports corruption to  "women who have been drugged and raped at fraternity parties not being sensationalist" but rather a "straightforward" occurrence.  Sadly, the University of Central Florida is typical of what a college education has come to in the U.S. Contrast these backward hat wearing idiots to the Canadian character on display in the Broadway play depicting the airline passengers welcomed to Canada during 9/11.
Raps are toast.  Zero character.  Zero class.  Zero heart.  It'll be nice when their season is over, so the players can ship out of Toronto.  Goodbye, human garbage!
Only an Okee from Muskogee could make such a dumb fire suppression comment.  Quit scribbling around and let your dog out.
Thank you for showing the extent of white, christian, republican arrogance through brainwashing.  Later, when your son learns to think for himself, he will realize what an total asshole you are.  He will still love you, but he will no longer respect you are feel your opinions are worth his time.  Nice job, dad.
Watch  Some county idiot will settle for a undisclosed amount.
NO NO NO! don't tell your friend's mother what she told your daughter. She's 18. She has been on social media awhile, like everyone her age. She can choose to do tinder and send pics if she wants. 27 isn't that much older than her. Mind your own business! Once she's in college, she'll have plenty of distractions from this activity. Doing stupid stuff is part of growing up. Confiding to a friend and having that confidence broken - that a darned nasty lesson. This activity doesn't sound dangerous. People send pics of themselves every day. Chill out.
A third term for Obama?  Yeah!  More Muslim prayer rugs and transgender dressing in the military, more national debt--let's go for $50T.  Fewer to no Christian crosses and crèches anywhere.   More inedible school lunches,.  More unemployed and underemployed.  More bypassing the U.S. Constitution.  More freebies for the masses supported by more taxes for working people.  More tribes--class tribes, racial tribes, generation tribes, gender tribes, gender identity tribes.  More big government control of everything because we, the people, are too stupid to decide what's best for us in our own towns and states.  More hypocrisy--"do what I say but the rules don't apply to me and my political kind."  More straw men, so many we will think we are a nation of scarecrows.  I am so weary of having my intelligence insulted virtually every time Obama opens his mouth.  It's incredibly sad that so many people don't realize when they being called stupid.
good at being a loser
foolish
trump playing "chicken" with China with our country at stake is very dangerous and just plain stupid.
Trump ignored the suffering of 3.4 million AMERICANS to tweet about the NFL. Is that what you call leadership?  A real leader would offer support and words of encouragement and reassurance. Maybe ask for donations and drum up more interest.  That is what a leader does. A person with no idea how to lead does what Trump did.  Now he is acting like an entitled child tweeting idiotic comments directed at Puerto Rico's leaders.  He is pathetic.  Trump is more worried about his ego than the 3.4 million Americans in Puerto Rico. Trump is possibly the worst leader this nation has had the misfortune to have.
The truth I see is 8 policemen executed by thugs who decided to be judge and jury. These Men never had a chance - executed by cowards and it wasn't even the coward's job.
why pepper your comment with ridiculous statements like "King Justin"?  it's not helping your point, and it actually is quite irritating.  How can we ask more of our politicians when a simple comment, that is valid, stoops to childish name calling?  Grow up.
God Kizla you are such an idiot. You counter point your own points because you're trying to create drama, and seemingly have nothing of substance to say. Write a real article man.  Jhabvala makes you look like a child. Kubiak gone. 3 OC on the staff. 4 out 5 lineman replaced. 3 new RB. 2 great WR draft picks. New eventual starting TE. Special teams totally overhauled. Oh no Booker hurt his wrist and will be back in time for game 2, alert the NY times, good thing you don't run with your wrist. Defense as always will be spectacular. It's all on VJ and the QB, the talent is all around them.
You have a track record of leaving some of the most ridiculous comments and fueling the divisiveness you talking about.
The dept. of energy employees almost 13,000 federal employees and almost 93,000 contract employees.  I bet at least 75% of these are educated stupid people just looking for a paycheck and accomplish little or nothing daily.
You're so full of trashy comments, your breath stinks. "Even Hillary attacked Monica." You lie repeatedly, have zero credibility, and have the spelling skills of a drunk.
Yeah, because only Democrats do stupid things, right?
Ya'll just going to pretend Colin Kaepernick couldn't come in and instantly bring some swag and infuse the offense as an better option than all four QB's signed currently?  Really... Ego is a mutha... So much for putting the best team on the field.  Siemian is a back up.. Kyle Orton esq @ best. Meanwhile just wearing that stellar Defense thin with all the extra snaps they have to play due to that pathetic offense. Smh disheartening to watch as a fan.
Wow.  The Clown can't even give a mother condolences without being a total egotistical a$$hat.  What has our country come to?  Who are the real haters?
His friend beat the Delaware criminal justice system.... murder charges dropped and he was set free. Now he's trying to help his friend using same concept, poor black man. He is stupid..... made comment to media that when Smith was arrested for assault, made him cut his hair after that incident, BUT on the night of the shooting he had his dreads intact, that was one of the IDing charateristics. If cut his hair after, shooting makes his friend a co-conspriter.
RR what a complete ignorant kid like mis guided fool you seem to be. I bet u inspect your boogers before you eat them.
"We can do anything," Chenault quipped. "We're the Legislature." - except work it seems.  Mr. Chenault and crew, get your posterior anatomies busy get to work.  You waste more money each day by your silly games and posturing.
Chin is a hypocrite!!!!!!! He refused to fight and stop the foreign ship immigration ban known as the "Jones Act" which bans foreign ships from delivering goods to our islands directly!
Nonsense ........... Frequently the fat groper goes on TV or twitter ........... ................. and confirms what the media reported.
Dear Quebec Leaders, please draw up a budget with 8 billion subtracted from it.  That is about what you siphon off of Alberta through the equilization bribe.  Share with that ####off Montreal Mayor, the amount they will subtract.  Tell the public how this"win" will impact taxes and services.   All that was asked was to run a safe and managed pipe to the East coast.  Lost jobs and no impact on C02, since this would do nothing to increase consumption.  What a bunch of malarki from some real idiots.
On James Clapper:  James Clapper resigns as US director of national intelligence - The Guardian, 17 Nov 2016  "In March 2013, months before Snowden provided the Guardian and the Washington Post with voluminous NSA data documenting sweeping domestic and international communications dragnets, Clapper had a public colloquy with Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the intelligence committee.  Wyden asked Clapper: “Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions, or hundreds of millions, of Americans?” Clapper replied, untruthfully: “No sir,” rubbing his head. “Not wittingly.” "  Clapper is famous for having lied under oath to Congress, and the American people, concerning the NSA's surveillance programs. He is also well known for having fired Trump aide Michael Flynn from his directorship at the Defense Intelligence Committee.  Clapper is a proven liar, and a political animal through and through.
It does not matter if you say you believe in gay rights.  You have failed to show that using religion to discriminate is a right guaranteed by the Constitution.  If I were dumb enough to agree in writing to allow you to 'come into my world and make me do things I don't want to do' then I get what I deserve, just like the baker.
Israel is the only friend the US has in the Middle East, and also has nuclear weapons. Would you prefer our nuclear friend to be our enemy, like North Korea? Thanks to Obama's "no intervention" policy, NK got nukes during his presidency. Israel serves as a deterrent to any open war against the US from the Middle East. Your calling them "traitor" shows your abysmal ignorance  of the geopolitical structure of the world and proves that your opinion is garbage, worth only ignoring. Dismissed!
Re: "What the hay does "cross-straight relations " mean?"  That's a question Mr. Trump should have asked ... BEFORE he took that call.  It's bad that he's ignorant, but horrific that he's wilfully ignorant.
Who believes in that silly "Devil" anymore in this educated and enlightened society?
There are many, many browny jobs on the line; if ( I'm one of them ) don't become President. A slow boat back to their root's. Clinton loves to surround herself with her bro's and sisters, not that white trash. And I seem to remember America intervening in elections abroad? The CIA throwing money at the candidate that was pro-American? What is good of us, is not good for them? Nothing more than a ploy by ( stay at home and bake cookies ) Clinton, to discredit Trump.
The face of the media inspired Alt-Left... Sore losers all.
Pruitt is just another idiot in Bizarro World Trump Land.
Hey, the dumbest man on the planet was recently elected to the PMO, so Canadians don't appear to be overly concerned about the intellectual heft of their politicians.  How is Nenshi at yoga planking?
The splc is just a bunch of racist pigs. I get their idiotic mail now and then. Of course they love the blm thugs they are exactly the same. Racist nasty pigs.
Mr. Donovan:  I have several times suggested that in my layman's opinion, Mr. Trump is a sociopath.  I have referenced the definition of sociopath and the list of behaviors characterizing sociopathy.    "Never trust a sociopath. He's a liar. He lies to get his way, he lies to hurt, and sometimes he lies just for his own amusement. A sociopath is extremely skilled at lying, so much so that it always seems as though he's telling the truth. As a pathological liar, a sociopath constantly makes up stories so captivating that people easily believe them." source Healthy Place   I must say, Mr. Trump has lied all his life...his personal life, his business life, and, now of course, his political life.  Read any site which addresses sociopathy and decide for yourself if you think Trump's a sociopath.  If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck....... Gary Crum
So, how are you idiots coming on that 0bama dossier, with college transcripts and criminal records?
SJWs are losers, and soon will bring the Church down to their level.
What happened to transparency?  Really, he made the meeting private, behind closed doors.  I thought I heard and saw everything from this clown president, but I guess there is more to come.
Trump Bunnies will be hurting too, but they're too stupid to understand they did it to themselves.
Shut up flavio you internet comment board philosopher. Portland is being taken over by dipshit transplants who came from places with higher costs of living so they can afford to buy a second car and ice cream cones 7 days a week, and they heard Portland was cool. They're doing nothing but making real estate prices skyrocket and pushing out all of the people and businesses that made Portland so cool in the first place. Unfortunately Gresham isn't urban enough to become what Portland was and there are way to many cops in Vancouver so I don't know what's going to replace it. Maybe Bend? Austin, TX? Boulder, CO?
NOT IN THE USA ? What a buffoon..................It certainly was in the USA !
If nothing else, this will give the big, fat orange buffoon something to keep him occupied and away from doing anything damaging until he is impeached .
Little factual information in this puff-piece, Mr. Pitts, except for the disturbing message that voting is somehow "dangerous"... If there is any "danger" in your ill-conceived tirade let's introduce you to a few historic proponents: Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Kim Jong Un...all convinced that the average person it too stupid to vote.
Obama needs no help from anyone to be a failure.  He is very capable of doing that on his own.
Gee, where are all the Trumpnuts today?  Well, they'll be here soon, right after they get their talking points handed to them by the Orange Fuhrer.   I've said it before and I'll say it again, the media should seek their news about the White House from reputable sources only, which excludes Trump, Conway, Spicer and everyone in his administration.  The media should cut Trump off at the knees.   Give Trump enough rope and he hangs himself.
What was Obama thinking in the first place?  Millions of people are fleeing war and instead of helping them he agrees to take people who are already safe?  WTH?  Who does that help?  Turnbull.  Trump is right the deal is dumb.  But it also stinks of some dirty quid pro quo.
Just like the city under incompetent Jon Ruiz, EWEB jumps in and spends millions of dollars relocating operations without having a complete plan. Pathetic.
“The actions were the latest legal blow to the administration’s efforts to temporarily ban refugees as well as travelers from six predominantly Muslim countries.” ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  On February 27, while mired in his ham-fisted attempt to repeal and replace Obama Care, Trump ludicrously observed, “‘Nobody knew health care could be so complicated.”  Now, it seems this politically ignorant neophyte is learning something else everyone else already knew: being president is so complicated, especially when you try to circumvent the US Constitution. Trump is beginning to find out that the presidency is not an entry level position.
But it's much easier and more enjoyable to rip on the ethically challenged, hypocritical, beady eyed, part-time mayor  Krookwell...
Your a disgusting person to post such hate. I'm going to pray for you. You shouldnt believe everything you read. There was a massive clean up crew. https://medium.com/@madelinemerritt/standing-rock-cleanup-crew-the-true-story-62506218be93#.4lc8gdbz5
Your comment is ridiculous. Child protection laws in Canada  are unaffected by this bill. More importantly, there is the legal definition of "the age of reason" or age of Majority and Accountability, at which an individual is deemed legally able to make life-changing decisions for themselves...such as driving, drinking, voting, or smoking. In general, that is between the ages of 16 and 18.  A 6 year old child in Canada doesn't have the legal right to make decisions for themselves; what makes you believe, in any credible way, that any court or agency in the country would think a 6 year old (who, legally, isn't even considered mature enough to form the intent to commit a crime) should nevertheless be removed from its family because its wishes regarding gender weren't being respected by its parents? That's a farcical notion bordering on fear mongering. Go back and rethink your argument.
"What you need to know?" There will be nothing new from Trump; it will just be the same bunch of lies and constant move to increase the swamp and make himself and his cronies wealthier at the expense of the American people. I can't believe that Americans have been this stupid.
Go ahead and get rid of President Trump, and see what happens.  Firstly to your pigs and their whores, and then to the rest of you maggots.
KMA. We have the Constitutional right to use any highway or road to protest. You kill any Natives lately? Hit and run? You're pathetic.
In principle and practice, I agree with this.  Except in the case of the idiot in the WH who lost the popular vote and is systematically destroying the country and the planet. Not this time. Not my president...ever.
Sly,slick dictator and dullard dictator wannabe.
Troll warning!  "News Flash from Wiki Leaks: Hillary Clinton 'hate[s] everyday Americans'".  -- Who let the dogs out?  This is been debunked completely.    "It was clear from the context of the email that Podesta was referring only to the phrase 'everyday Americans,' as he was discussing language for a speech Clinton was set to deliver in New Hampshire."  http://www.businessinsider.com/wikileaks-email-hillary-clinton-everyday-americans-2016-10  Next time try to understand that other folks aren't as stupid as you ... think.  And don't rely on Putin's private channel as your source.  -- Paul
Assuming the "everyday Americans" being referred to are these same idiots and racists that support Trump, I'd say Hillary is definitely not alone in hating such people. Anyone with a minimum of intelligence and personal dignity is offended by these cretins who make all Americans look backward and mentally deficient.  It really depends on how you define "everyday Americans" and if you look at Hillary's platform, that is, the policies she has stated on record that she intends to pursue when she becomes president, I say, I don't care who someone said they think Hillary hates as long as she actually tries to implement the non-rich people-friendly policies she has crafted in her policy statements.  Seriously, what's the option--voting for Republicans? These people are always saying how much they love average Americans while they stab them in the back supporting policies that favor only the rich. The policies favored by Republicans are a matter of public record.
Wow I am impressed not a single officer lost her cool, faced with such mass stupidity - which is truly sad - and this pathetic shrieking asshole who so desperately needs have his ass kicked.   Eugene Police, I am proud of you!
Another cause of the sewage spills rather than "human error" could be better attributed to stupidity, Incompetence, negligence. I suppose it is kind of late in the game since Capt Kirk well into his second and last term as Mayor but maybe not too late to fire the environmental services director who seems to be a prime example of the Peter principle, you know rising to the level of your incompetence.
Yet another  example of disgraceful, corrupt scofflaws running Eugene's bureaucracy.
So you are saying "this person's own morals may be crap, but I will accept him as a moral leader". That makes no sense.
Of course she will Win!!! The Liberals hold that seat with no problem. Think about this, Wynn and the Ontario Liberals are the most Corrupt party ever in Canada. They still may in the next election. Ontario does NOT care if the Liberals are corrupt. The Ontario voters were Rated the dumbest people in all the whole  world.
The Chinese sign non binding expressions of interest like this with lots of fanfare and previous little specificity, usually when they are trying to lever other suppliers the threat of a new player. These are the sort of announcements are usually the political products used by wind bags to impress fools. In this case, Walker is only fooling himself.   Financing doesn’t make a project go, signed binding agreements from credit worthy partners committing to take the volumes of gas at prices sufficient to provide an adequate risk adjusted market return to cover the cost of construction and development are the only things that make a project like this viable.   The Chinese are playing Walker for a sucker and wasting our money in the process.
Yes that's exactly what I'm implying. Given the tone of the pro-debate people commenting here, classy is the last word I'd use.  Should I assume that your referring to me as "ignorant and hypocritical" is your way of being "classy"?
Ken:  In this PC world and with all time highs in criminal activity etc., only Stupid people use their REAL name on these types of PC activities .  Ask Dr. Phil, he will tell you, "Well, thats just STUPID".
The phrase "fake news" is ridiculous.  Correct term should just be "lies".
El Presidente Dorito looks, thinks and acts like a clown, and its the media's fault?
Not at all...the "progressive" left hates documents that name the Creator as the the origin of our rights since they believe in no God higher than the state. The only people concerned with white supremacists are idiots who watch CNN and have been convinced by the fake news there's a monolithic problem when in reality a few irrelevant bumpkins are all that's left of the KKK. The Russia narrative died a slow and painful death and now "White Supremacy" is the new buzz phrase of the so-called "resistance". All hogwash.
Balderdash! Achievement is achievement and there's nothing of what you claim being favored, overlooked, disguised or (thankfully), cut.  Your statement is as ignorant as it wrong.
"Justin Trudeau clinches climate deal despite Christy Clark’s balk"  Clinches climate deal? Why did the just come out and say Canadians are stupid? What a sickening condescending headline.
As I said above...I'll bet my paid off home that Trump does not have proof..  Love it that these jerks are still protecting a lair and a failure of a president..  But then again, that is why America is the stupidest nation in the industrial world..
Ain't going to happen, and you are looking at 2-3 more retirements in the next 8 years. Obama and other Dem senate leaders have done (I can share the data with you if you would like) the same thing. hypocrisy at it's finest.
He's a god damn leftard. They are nothing but hypocrites.
Slavery is a far outcry, nay, a far more serious tragedy in this country than merely not baking cakes for someone entering in a gay marriage. That was a preposterous statement/claim to even compare the to. White racist savage landlords ruthlessly challenging the lives of people's having come from or descended from persons from the Africa Continent is barbaric. Refusing to make cakes, is not.
How could anyone vote for this jerk, who cost his constituents millions of dollars to try to get the death penalty for someone who was willing to plead guilty and go to prison for life, which is exactly what he got after that massively expensive trial.  He was only interested in the exposure so that the could run for governor.  What a jerk!
AGAIN!,, the soviets never helped the taliban ignorant one, they invaded and the taliban  were an offset of the mujahideen who fought against the taliban!  as for the usa, they were completely justified to invade as it was the Taliban protecting the terrorist and UBL of 911.
This clown Bishop McElroy along with quite a few others apparently, just doesn't get it:  A Muslim's primary purpose in life to to exterminate Christians, or anyone else who doesn't think like them.  Sweden is now the rape capitol of Europe and second in the world in rapes per capita, all thanks to the Muslim invaders.  They don't think like we do.  They do not share our values.  They have no respect for women, the environment, animals, or human life.  McElroy is naive and a fool.  Hopefully Darwins principle removes him from the picture because what he preaches is cultural and religious suicide.  A war is coming over the fate of the earth - Islam or Christianity.  We all need to pick which side we want to be on and quit consorting with the enemy.
You all have had 7 chances to get rid of this parasite and his entire government. Has not succeeded yet. All tarred with the same brush.
"We can turn out all the black votes you want," Reed, chairman of the ADC, said in a telephone interview. "But somebody's got to talk to the white voters; it's not our challenge to do that. We can talk to everybody, but white voters got to hear from white folks."  And we conservatives are the racists?? Unbelievable...
Trump will have the rest of the world against him in everything if he persists in his stupidity.
Right. Same reason I don't go to gun shows. I can't deal with all the weirdos.
Yeah, Gershon, the government white collar criminals are incumbents in our capitol.  How many of them are you planning to re-elect?
Fish whore?
President Donald J Trump is doing a great job in spite of all the flack. Full speed ahead. It must be a sad situation for the losers.
Trump  is  a bimbo who can't spell president, much less economy.  He calls himself the next "precedent."  And he declared bankruptcy 6 times,   stiffed the tradespeople and inverstors who built his gaudy towers and used donations to his so-called charitable foundation to enrich himself.  The Twit-in-Chief  is a loser and a horse's  a**  who the much more intelligent Putin will have dancing his tune before January is out.  The electoral college have a lot to answer for.
Well, it's a grand day for The Idiot's Parade led by their Mad King Trump!
Only difference is the Feds paid over 80% of the cost for the H3 and we have a Roadway that anyone can use.    Oh and it helps traffic, and provides 1000 times more than a single rail line can ever provide.   see how good roads are.  Rail line to a shopping mall for 20 Billion is a STUPID idea !
Progressive states will continue to adopt sanity in opposition to trump's policies of corruption, greed, and regressive stupidity. Too bad other states will take advantage of trump's idiocy to turn back progress on critical environmental advancements.
Seems you trolls don't like to be trolled.  I though you MAGAphants love hate filled rhetoric.  Breitbart, Alex Jones, Trump rallies.  You guys thrive on it.  But then again, you're all to dumb to see how you're being duped into being Trumps "poor confederate soldiers" who will get screwed in the end.  Cmon, go back to getting your white robes and hoods clean for the next Trump rally.   I'm sure the US military will love that.
Feminists = liberal-leftists = anarchists = terrorists = islamists = fascists = dumbists !!!!
Well stated. He probably thinks Ryan Air came by that $6000.00 unfairly, seeing as how they are capitalist pigs and all, so too bad. Every small business has $6000.00 laying around that they could do without.. They light their cigars with the bills.
Sunny ways my foot.! All rotten, corrupt selfish politicians ...ALL OF THEM!
You don't even believe your own nonsense.  He's Putin's puppet, he's no leader.
Time for Canada to turn it's back on the corrupt Liberals.  There should be "NO CASH FOR ACCESS".  Kathleen is doing it and now Junior is doing it.  How do people think that if I give a politician money to go to one of his dinners that he won't bend any rules for me.  This is absolutely insane for us to allow any form of this.  For Trudeau to say that influence will not happen for cash means he believes Canadians are stupid.  Are we really that stupid?  I hope not.
"...Salt Lake police spokesman Sgt. Brandon Shearer told local media that Payne had been suspended from the department’s blood draw unit but remained on active duty...."  Oh good.  The knucklehead is still out there with a loaded weapon.  I feel so safe now....pfft.  Nutbags like him are part of the reason I'm going for my CWP.  It isn't just the "criminals" I'm worried about (although this jerk is one just not charged).
I know things can get out of hand down there in Texas but do they really execute crazy people? I know they execute mentally retarded folks but seems to me that even in Texas you go to the nuthouse if you're crazy.
Racists like the horde that attacked Charlottesville are a boring and pathetic bunch. They really are the dregs, and very lost. Watching them troop by in their ratty military nazi regalia and chanting hate was the epitome of depressing. What a sad display they are, so full of fear.
I agree. Mindless idiots.
Just yesterday a man was very slowly walking, reading a book and carrying a coffee across a crosswalk on Amazon and 30th. He didn't lookup or stop reading the whole way across. It was 5:30pm he had no light and was wearing dark clothing. Idiot!
That's just what Assange of WikiLeaks announced to the entire world that the Podesta password was.    In an interview, apparently.  With some guy named Hannity.    Might even be true.  Somebody was certainly stupid with his e-mail.
You don't pay attention to anything, Chuckie beyond what's in front of your nose. But that's OK. We can manage without simpletons like you just fine.
Hey Johnny, apparently you live on Jupiter, because you're so utterly uninformed that you don't know about Dylan Roof.  Racist, white supremacist Christian who committed a deplorable act of terror.  So in other words, you're an idiot as well as a bigot.
Trump has filed for bankruptcy many, many times so it appears you CAN be a buffoon and a multi millionaire, especially if have competent people around you to cushion you from the worst of your mistakes.  It's unbelievable that Republcans are so far gone on voting the party line that they're rptalking themselves into  actually voting for this clown. Any residual respect I may have had for conservatives is gone.
when it comes to the PFD, most Alaskans are whores
Ha ha, your failure to understand betrays you. It would have been better to not respond and show your ignorance.
From the same fools who would have us double military expenditures while denying climate change.  Typical.
Ok. You asked for it...3 months ago today, how many people did you greet? Where exactly were you with each person? What exactly did you say to each person? What exactly did each person say to you? What time was exactly that you met each one of  them? What were each of them wearing? What were you wearing? And finally guess what...no matter what you say, I will call you a liar.  So go ahead and prove to me that you aren't lying. Get the picture of how stupid the libtards sound on the hill? Once again, you validate my point that with any libtards there is just no fixing stupid.
Talking about the Lunatic Liberal  that wrote the piece, I see!
What on earth kept them from knowing this about Trump two years ago? Everyone knew he was like this. Yet they still backed this disastrous narcissist thinking they could ride him to power. What a disaster.
Morneau is an unethical piece of  solid excretory product evacuated from the bowels.
$100 Million Dollars????? As an hvac contractor in Oregon, I am sitting here in utter disbelief at the blatant stupidity.. In 15 years they will be replacing the equipment again.  What a bunch of fools.
Also if things are manufactured in the US again, the prices will go up a lot so lets see how much American consumers like paying a lot more for stuff.  If Trump had even an elementary understanding of economics he would know this is a bad idea.  Most past presidents run on protectionist rhetoric as they know much of the public is dumb enough to fall for it, but once in power don't follow through as they know it is economically stupid to do so.
There are plenty of cases where Trump is cruel and awful. We’ve seen plenty of those. In those cases, his predatory, sociopathic nature is plainly evident.
I'm sorry that Mr. Fife's blinders do not permit him to recognize the products of the Russian troll factories and comment on them as such.  This case is about as plain as day. Lenin had a phrase about "useful idiots" and I must say he had a gift for recognition and definition.
At what point will any and ALL publications of this sort quit even publishing garbage like this?  We are all entitled to our own opinions but not the facts that one can't find in this criminally stupid opinion.  Indeed, the sky is falling. http://www.ucar.edu/news/releases/2006/thermosphere.shtml literally, at least in density
It's pretty simple to condemn BOTH the alt-right racist scum  and awful anti-Western attitudes like those the Islamists have.    I've heard Sam Harris do it pretty well.    Definitely cozying up to Trump on his nativism is not the way to go. He is the doddering old crazy uncle that sane people should ignore.
Cory Gardner has some work to do, however he is 100% right on this. I can't understand why anyone would have a problem with this statement unless they subscribe to the same beliefs as the domestic terrorists who have the blood of Heather Heyer on their hands. This is not a joke. This is life and death, and trump is playing with a loaded weapon by encouraging these cretins.
Ronald Reagan was and is one of my heroes.  Actually, having lived through his times, I do not agree that he left office reviled.  He was reviled throughout his presidency by the liberal intellectuals.  I remember at a talk given at Harvard by Nobel physicist N.  Bloembergen how the liberal audience snickered and laughed at how stupid Reagan was for thinking that we could have protection from ICBMs.  Dr. Bloembergen, who was not particularly political, took questions and quietly blew away the technical objections laughingly raised by the liberals showing that they the liberals rather than Reagan were stupid.
Why bother with Spicer's press briefings? Might as well put Kellyanne Conway up there for one of her lying, fact-twisting, useless monologues.
What do you want, Chucky? It was your babbling and crap that Fox News fed the R Base that resulted in Dumb Dumb. You created him. Now, get to work on controlling or impeaching Dumb Dumb.
Please invite them to stay home!!! He's an embarrassment.
#pizzagate? #spiritcooking? #birtherism? The Repugnicans won with the appeal of gullibility and stupidity, for those who voted for the sociopathic, isolationist, xenophobic racist with the red tie, dark suit. 'Murika!
As for Joseph and Mary that is only true, if you ignore the fact that Mary was a virgin.  How can you be an adulteress when you do not have sex? As far as the rest, your implications are sick.
What is happening? Power is being taken away from the billionaire oligarchy and their little bum boy, Bernstein, is sent out to lie to the chumps.
Come on lespark, you can do better than this.  I know it is hard to stand up for the Donald but try.  Just insulting Allie does not a case make.   You might have pointed out that the Donald is hardly a buffoon as he is an Orangoutang.  :-)  It is so much fun having this clown as president.    http://www.thedailybeast.com/bill-maher-calls-out-trump-show-us-the-dick-certificate
This joker Painter is brain damaged.  Sad to hear him rant.
PS, I feel kinda bad for you.  All the Hate is coming from you and your fellow hate monger democraptics.  (sp intentional)  You people have called  Trump everything in the book.  You are tone deaf to your own party spewing hate. Did you notice the big COLLUSION theory you all have spouting was just more BS.   Months and months of "He's colluding with Russia", but no, just more Democraptic nonsense.  I can only wonder why Trump doesn't hit back harder.
Gov. Ben told us what to expect. So all you fools that voted for Coldwell, You Got What You Voted For ! Rail will be Built on Time and on Budget !
The Chump and his band of idiots are masters of organized chaos. Just a matter of time before KABOOM.
Millionaire oil man gets frustrated causes him to rerun Saudi garbage. Go ahead no one cares and Gov. Walker and legislators had better listen to us. If not then you and Juneau asked for backlash from thousands of pissed off citizens!
Total nonsense from Bernstein. it's the Liberal media that is malignant with their continuous FAKE news.
He didn't lash out at Gold Star families. That's a lie. I will take the Generals word as truth.You are a drama queen and obviously your hate and the congresswoman hate are toxic.
How stupid can you be as to act up in a foreign country? Idiots. They're an embarrassment.
' In other news tonight,   .  Alleged National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn got caught again deleting a tweet that he made up about Hillary Clinton, money laundering and sex crimes involving children.  The man's a sick and demented menace. .
Sell that crap elsewhere, Boris...
You know what he meant, just had to be an ass over spelling.
You are a troll,
Tonite The Village Idiot has spoken on HNIC. Accusing a player to be the ultimate idiot has some level of understanding. Cherry has written the book on idiotic values. He is the master of them all!
Sorry, I voted for the NDP, not a CPC supporter. I can't stand Trudeau. He's a liar and is selling this country out to Chinese billionaires. Take off your blinders.
A stupid post. Scaramucci is an utter fool agreed but to call him right wing is to disclose the fact that you do not know what right or left wing tags mean. He is a clown, he is a foul mouthed thug and I would say he could be regarded as a "crony-capitalist", but genuine right-wing, no.
She's a cheat  She's anti catholic  She threatens her husband sexual accusers  She sold state department  She pro partial birth abortion  Go to confession soon
What a ridiculous comment.  If you can give me the price level of 30 years ago, sure, I will buy another house!  I would love it if my kids could soon buy at the price to rent ratio of 1987.  But the fact is that prices are far higher now, measured by any normal metric (price/income, price vs. rent, and price vs. its own long-term trend).  Are you seriously claiming that they will go from 8 x income to 20???
Callista goes to the Vatican has all the ingredients of high comedy. Trump sells himself as "pro-family" and "pro-life" is farce. Trump's presidency -- Trump being corrupt, incompetent, and unstable -- is pure tragedy.
Actually Trump aloud and weak up the race car again, We was coping and dealing with this never ending issue in the U.S. with calm, Then Obama brow back it because He was Black, Now again we are dealing with this stupid same old story.
Trump is dangerously crazy. Now watch him bully his "allies" into whatever he decides - consequences be damned. It's getting depressing.
Simple, I don't want my back covered by one of these losers.
“dumb” ==== Trump just realizes that to be the "leader of free world", you have to keep milking your allies or lending a free hand to them all the time. He is promoting "America First" and can't stand it. Nothing comes free in this "free world".
' …that comment is asinine. .
Buffoon in Chief . . . what do you expect?
Sorry, my previous post should note "kuleana" and Doug Chin "is NOT penny wise and pound foolish"
Mike is not an MRA - but he is a total douche.  I don't believe that any actual death/rape threats or home addresses were tweeted to Miller.  Make no mistake though, Mike is trying to drag this out and get as many big names involved (Metzger, Rogan, Cumia, McInness) so his truly awful self involved hate podcast will get numbers.  He claims he cares about these issues but it's definitely about only about his ego.  Just look at this Mancow wannabe and his dumb golf putter trying to look all hard. Super cringy.
there is  no doubt the GOP with trump will send the destructive left wing stupid policies that have done real damage to the usa back to the heap of trash where they belong
we know we are unlucky to have a bias lunatic left winger in you posting the usual nonsense, we deserve credit for exposing your stupidity
Why should any moron be invited to the White House just because his greatest contribution to humanity is that he can bounce a ball while chewing gum?
I do not like the way Canada votes so I am not going to take place. I play by MY rules not some stupid ones somebody else made up.
They've tried lies, fantasies and totally corrupt concepts, emerging as assholes at each turn. When does the stink become unbearable?
"You realize of course that both the finalists and final winner were selected by the public via a vote right?"  Final winner?  Yes. Finalists?  No.  Why are you making things up?  Afraid of how idiotic social engineering makes people look?
Yes, the intolerant left..... and news that is decidedly biased....... I laughed watching CNN last night. Don Lemon highlighting "fine people" as Trump said on both sides.... (and undoubtedly there were on both sides - not everyone who wants the statues to stay is a Nazi) So, what does CNN highlight? The worst scum you could ever imagine.... They just twist every single thing Trump has to say.....
Thank you Cory for saying it! More Republicans need to do this since Trump certainly won't/can't. And then they need to do what it takes to get rid of this mentally ill bigot!
Judd would be better served by keeping his mouth shut.  He is only confirming his ignorance.
My brother worked for Canada Trust. He was told off the record that if it came between hiring a woman in her 20's-30's or a man, hire the man. That was 20 years ago. I'm confident the situation has only gotten worse for career minded women.  This is one of Justins dumbest ideas and will only create more so-called wage gap.
What a hypocrite you are! Unbelievable. When there is an article which is void of facts that support your arguments who cannot stop ranting about it. Yet when there is an article void of facts which might contradict your arguments, you just pretend they do not exist. In this case you make a bunch of ASSUMPTIONS...with silly comments referencing "sperm donors" and wondering what this says about the woman in the first place. Even suggesting a visit to Planned Parenthood. Maybe she was divorced...maybe her husband of the first two children left her....or died...you have no clue but that does not stop you from ripping her to shreds. Maybe you should try cleaning up your posts before worrying about Eugene. Incredible.
Socialist scum.  These are the same people that backed the communist party in WWII, now they're socialist.  Phony's just like their acting.  Committed to the "unreal".
How can anyone think of voting for the corrupt Hillary.  The liberals have deceived the republic for too long.  I was a long time Democrat  and I am appalled by the corruption in our Federal, State and City government.  Thank God Trump won.
You will see the following in future campaign ads:  "Statements made by the candidate are not to be construed as promises or guarantees.  They may be changed, modified or rescinded at any time at the sole discretion of the candidate."  Now all political candidates can lie like hell and get away with it like they always do.  Stupid decision that makes a joke of our whole democracy.
What a bunch of slimy chiseling Zuptoids! With  bonuses!
Terry Frei was a Pro's Pro.  His columns were enjoyable. But his ultimate downfall was that  he wasn't near far Left enough for WAPO's bastard son, the DP!
Oh my, Diaper Girl is back, with more of her witless left-wing blather.  Anything new today there Pampers Princess?  Or just the same, lame manure...?
"That's why I am not yet a paying member of NCR."  RD, since you use NCR's web page on a daily basis that makes you a parasite.
He's a "true conservative", Peter. That's means he's a self-satisfied, arrogant, bloviating coward like his hero, Mango The Man Baby.
To put the above groups in the same class as the Globes and bully wood isn't possible, actually the stupidest statement I've heard in a long time.
Team Stupid had better shut down the cross country tour  The peasants have their pitchforks out and want a head in a basket
Total recovery is never an option.  No matter how many years have passed whenever you hear a loud pop you jump as if you are getting shot.  You startle very easily. You shake in fear if you hear people arguing!  You are afraid to go out alone.  You still get terrifying nightmares.  I know because this is me.  Regardless, the best thing I ever did was to leave this sick coward!
If you were stupid enough to attend Trump University you deserve the "education" you paid for.  Where's the story on unhappy grads of Soros' University of Phoenix or lawyers suing law schools because they can't find jobs?  This stuff going on all over, but the Bolshevik Propaganda Vanguard at ADN/NYT/WaPo/Reut don't miss an opportunity to turn it into Trump bashing.   Why is this story from Reuters and not Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos' Washington Post you may ask? Perhaps in retrospect, realizing that tens of billions of his paper wealth could be wiped out with a stroke of Trump's pen in an anti-trust investigation,Bezos wised up and will be toning down his hack-job.    David Stockman: "America’s voters fired their ruling elites last night. After 30 years of arrogant misrule and wantonly planting the seeds of economic and financial ruin throughout Flyover America, the Wall Street/Washington establishment and its mainstream media tools have been repudiated like never before in modern history."
String up this antisocial animal.
And just as importantly,  we need to direct resources toward legal immigrants, rewarding their lawful efforts with an efficient and expeditious process. The idea that if you escape detection, take advantage of the system, and come up with a sad story you should somehow cut in line and keep the poor schmuck who followed the rules waiting, makes my blood boil. We need to be diligent in keeping  illegal immigrants out and bringing legal ones in, because the myriad of issues this absurd lack of enforcement has created is drowning our systems.   And honestly I think that Denver Public Schools officials would just melt into a soggy mess on the playground if we ever get control of immigration. They are so vehement that any change would destroy DPS as we know it.  I've already outlined a reasonable and humane compromise to deal with DACA beneficiaries.
McCain finished at the bottom of his class for a reason.  This dim-witted neo-con got us into a war wtih Iraq- a country that had done nothing to us.  That war resutled in about one million dead, 4,500 of whom were Americans.  It added to the US debt by at least one trillion dollars.  How does McCain propose to pay for his endless wars?  More taxes?  Or just putting the bill on the US credit card and letting our grandkids pay for it?  The sad thing is the special interests fund idiots like McCain so they can get re-elected and continue to damage our country.
you lunatics of left wing bs are pathetic with your so called arguments! ,
oh ignorant fool, many small businesses may not be able to just raise prices cause of competition thus having to slash jobs!! ,
And for Ibbitson, the BS never stops.  A Duracell liberal loser.
Right on point.  He threw Naeole under the bus but the problem is Rolo.  Rolaids is nothing more than an OC at best. In my opinion Stutz is also the sissy and should be fired for leading Rolo around by the nose.  Pride Rock, play warrior?  Knock off the silly phrases and just play hard nosed football!!!
You are idiot. That is not my point and you know it. Regulating business is of course necessary. I am a small business owner so I live it every day. Telling me what kind of customer I have to serve is a totally different issue. I have had the jcassional customer who are irrational jerks and I have told them I do not want there business. Rare but it happens.
Trash
You're right of course, but one of the idiots on his staff surely pointed out there is absolutely no "upside" to having recordings.
AAY, you d@m punks, stay the $#@& OUT of Mililani!  While you're at it, get a job for money and get a girlfriend(or boyfriend) to get off.  Robbing and raping in Mililani just ain't gonna hunt.
It crushes initiative of those who actually work.  The PFD is welfare attracting Pilgrim-type scum
Looks like dumb and dumber.
Forgot about ole Ross and his giant sucking sound.  Funny how after all these years politicians still suck.
Look at the hairpullers and teethknashers bashing someones comments regarding a member of a very dangerous cult. "Paranoia", "phobia" are ridiculous terms to use when "prudent caution" is far more appropriate.
I want the Globe And Mail to stop this Trump-bashing everyday! We are sick and tired of it. We also feel just like the Americans who voted for him. We are sick an tried of corrupt establishment losing our manufacturing jobs to cheaper labour markets because of free-trade deals. We are sick and tried of the mass immigration into our country. We NEED someone like Trump to 'drain the swamp' here in Canada! So don't tell us how we think Globe And Mail. We are fed up too!
Do you have kids? I do. My mom had 4. We were poor, and we got home doctored a lot, but she wouldn't have hesitated to take any one of us to the ER for something as painful as a broken bone.   Trumpski is a waking nightmare. I'd feel sorry for the morons who voted for him and are now going to lose medical care, Medicare, social security etc. but I'm tired of giving them a pass.   As has been sarcastically stated by Trumpnuts many times since Trumpski was elected, "elections have consequences;" welcome to yours, Trump states.  You'd better hope Trumpski throws you a bone.
What's really telling is that trump has spent so much more time expressing outrage about nfl players quietly and respectfully exercising their constitutional right to protest injustice than he did about violent racists loudly marching through the streets with torches.  And, btw, he expects those players to endanger their health unnecessarily for his amusement.  Sad and pathetic!
OMG! no pipeline jobs but another apology!  what a pathetic bunch
predictably the liberal democrats run like cowards from this editorial.
White evangelical Christians worship the Pussy Grabber In Chief. Gee, I wonder why so many people are checking the None box these days? We just had eight years of a President who was a loyal husband and wonderful father to two daughters. And he never called either one of his daughters and I quote, "A piece of a**" while talking live on the air with Howard Stern. Unlike Trump who has consistently lied, cheated, and disrespected his daughters and three wives FOREVER! Guess Barack Obama's skin was the wrong color to get any respect from evangelicals. If the lying, adulterous, vulgar, tax cheating, racist, misogynist, bigoted, narcissistic, ignorant, draft dodging, boy-man Trump is the new Christian hero, just what kind of Christianity is being practiced in the US nowadays?
"You're either for or against, and if you can't decide who you like more and you're split on who you should stand beside, I'll do it for it for you with this: Fuck you."  Well said, dipschidt.  Fuck you.
He will tell you that God is against abortions knowing that Numbers 5:11-33 details a forced trial by abortion for a woman thought to have cheated on her husband. They have an aborticide that they add dust from the Tabernacle of the Temple. If God hated abortions, why let them use dust from the holy of holies? This little clown is dumber than he looks.
Just what we need.  More idiots being loud and having 'the time of their life' while the rest of the sane population tries to enjoy the nature of the park.  I have photos taken with a 400mm lens of a juvenile eagle on one of his initial flights taken from that tree.  No chance of that any more.  Why are we allowing humans to use one of our greatest treasures (these beautiful trees) to make a buck, and how does it benefit the park.  We're turning our best treasures into amusement parks.  Pathetic.  Hopefully someone in power can 'cut their ropes'...
Trump has given new meaning to the term POTUS: i.e. Totally Useless Piece Of S**t.
The enemy  is at the gate but the prostitute in charge will capitulate.
Picture yourself owning one of these new license plates. Now picture a scumbag thief swiping it and putting it on a stolen vehicle.
I'm happy you weren't, Kevin. The judge was a bonehead. It's an easy case and he blew it.
Please continue ridiculing.  It keeps reminding them why they need to resist.
Congratulations to the very UNchristian religious fanatics who have hijacked this forum, which could have been a place for empathy and discussion, but is now a site for argument over their chest-beating bible thumping. Sickening.
Elizabeth May makes the mistake of thinking that the other European leaders are as stupid as the people who voted "Leave", and just as easily manipulated. . The wake-up call will not be slow in arriving ...
We all know that that cop isn't sorry he just didnt want to get fired the cops in eugene use their title to abuse the rights of the citizens of this city. They think that they can get away with everything and honestly nowadays they can its clear to anyone who isnt an ignorant dumbass that he ment to go for his throat even a blind man can see this. It's not hard to grab someones arm who is in handcuffs and sharlow is full of shit....
"I have no idea what to say in rational response to such an extreme (and I might add, insulting to at least half the nation) take on the election success of the president elect."  Really, utilitas?   Trump didn't get the support of over half the nation.  He finished second in the popular vote, and over 100 million voters didn't vote out of either indifference or Republican voter suppression.  Considering that the president-elect is a lying, misogynist, racist ignoramus who is including neo-Nazis in his inner circle, perhaps those voters who voted for him deserve to be insulted.
I started laughing a few sentences in and had to suppress groaning out loud. Also, I had many eye-rolls.   I just cannot even with these people.    This guy gets paid to write such swill? The cui bono must be that someone important wants to provide talking points, no matter how laughably stupid, to those that were dumb enough to vote for the game show host.
So...hippy indians want to control everything. Is there anything new here.
Oh USA, how the mighty have fallen... Between electing Trump, imprisoning millions of your own citizens, and the absolutely inconceivable pro-gun attitude, the country has become nothing but a pathetic joke around the world.
You have demonstrated your ignorance of the Catechism.   Canon 915 certainly applied to Tim Kaine due to the fact abortion is intrinsically evil verses the issues of prudential judgement.  It's too bad there are uneducated Catholics like you and Bishop McElroy destroying this Church.
The President would be more Presidential , if the press limited their reporting to actual facts and wrote their editorials on those facts.  So long as the media has its own agenda (publishing garbage), this President will react and fight back.  And surprisingly, Mr. Bernstien, middle America, will support him and not idiots like yourself who want to make news and not report it.
Wrong... what is malignant is the media.  What the media is doing is taking sides against half the country who believe what Trump is doing is the right thing and it is bias schmucks like you in the media that are part of the problem not part of the cure.    In fact for decades now you have declared war against the average working man/woman because you think YOU are enlightened and that the citizenry are too stupid to manage their our own lives... that YOU and big brother govt knows best.     So thanks but no thanks asking for our help in destroying Trump... we plan on destroying the scum in the media instead.
Meanwhile, you have long list of tedious Hollywood celebiot hypocrites with carbon footprints the size of Godzilla shilling for the climate blame industry.  Sadly, even after displaying this breathtaking insensitivity to the economic plight of ordinary Albertans, the likes of Hanoi Jane and her fellow Hollywood leftie elitists still don’t get why Trump won the election…..
"Don't these people work? Stupid question. It's hard to be a professional protestor if you have to get up every day and go to work."--It's Saturday.  The weekend.
' Trump's quote on using nuclear weapons.  “I’ve always thought about the issue of nuclear war; it’s a very important element in my thought process. It’s the ultimate, the ultimate catastrophe, the biggest problem this world has, and nobody’s focusing on the nuts and bolts of it. It’s a little like sickness. People don’t believe they’re going to get sick until they do. Nobody wants to talk about it. I believe the greatest of all stupidities is people’s believing it will never happen, because everybody knows how destructive it will be, so nobody uses weapons. What bullshit.” .

Why is Trump sending military aircrafts along the N Korean borders?  Does he want N Korea to send ground-to-air missiles against the aircrafts so he can then blame them for starting a war?  Trump should stop playing these stupid games.
$7500 annual went to housing alone? Are you people that stupid? Ok ADN just lost the tiny amount of respect I ever had for them. Most of us spend more like 18-24k on housing alone. Could you even try to think about housing yourself in ANC for 7500/ a year?! Where did this stupid busy body come from lol? Unbelievable as her or his daddy is funding his/her obviously stupid life.
With a third to half of all priests gay, their banning shrinks priesthood even more.  No married, no gays, no women.  Sick.
If white males are so sexist, how did Margret Thatcher, PM of England get elected?  If I recall, she got elected because she had a history of doing what she said she would do, not because she carried a ladies purse.
What a bunch of ignorant comments.   Mexican ID and Voter ID is the same thing..  The consulate services will be missed, legal resident aliens did use the services.
What a scary world we live in. An insane lunatic threatening nuclear destruction on another nation. An insane lunatic who thinks only of controlling the citizens of his country and trampling on their basic human rights. An insane lunatic who ignores the rights and safety of the other 7,000,000 human beings on the planet. An insane lunatic who is so narcissistic he thinks he's right and everyone else is wrong.   An insane lunatic named TRUMP!

please contribute honesty and facts instead of a bunch of obsessed crap which needs to be constantly corrected for a concerned public's interest.
"Trump is the Republican Party’s chemotherapy. A nauseating but" Why do I have to edit for the RG? "Trump is the Republican Party’s chemotherapy, a nauseating butt"....
Hopefully the average Canadian is smart enough to see through a right wing, ignoramus who's main concern is the bottom line of his business interests. But then again, many were stupid enough to vote for Harper.
This from a 1% who uses 3 corporations in his trust fund to get similar tax advantages, what a hypocrite!
You did not address the points I made annihilating your argument.  Don't call me a snowflake, and I won't call you a simpleton born to be a slave, you UN-civil dolt.
The republicans have the White House and the majority of the senate and House. That being said even a snail has made more progress than the idiot in chief and his circus of clowns. The Chump train is heading for certain derailment and the Chumpsters are stuck on it because they have s**t for brains.
Causality between population size and number of railway accidents...  We have an early leader for dumbest comment of the year.
You must have trouble seeing Canada from across the ocean to talk such nonsense.
Well, Demboski is an abhorrent idiot, so this sort of thing is solidly in her wheelhouse.  Sadly she's not up for re-election until 2019, hopefully voters in her district will remember she's a lying imbecile when voting time rolls around (though they haven't seem to have cared yet that she's a lying imbecile).
White male Anti-Globalists peacefully marching = Bad. Violent masked crypto-fascists throwing bricks = Good. Shut up slaves.  MSM
Once again the CIA's actions, beginning in 1980, have totally destabalised a country.  Special thanks to Ronald Reagan, Charlie Wilson, and the rest of the idiots that armed the country to the teeth.
Stupid comment
Gee you're a dumb one aint you Craigers.  Hillary's server is safe because she's been out of office how long?  Hahaha
I don't know how "irresponsible" [predicting the bombing North Korea] may be.  We're finding out that Trump has committed treason to gain the presidency in the service of the murderous Putin regime.    Trump is capable of doing anything if it puts more money in his hole.
This is what happens when thugs follow the gangbangin'. Just keep removing them from the gene-pool. When the dumb ones are all gone, the bangin' will slow down.
I don't expect much from this Prime Minister and his party and so far I haven't been disappointed. What has he done, okay I know he brought back the long form census. But his policies seems to mirror that of the Harper Conservatives on a number of files, such as healthcare and the environment.  The Liberals have thoroughly balled up electoral reform and the new fighter aircraft, raised a number of taxes and have already began the sleazy road down to cash for access. Only an idiot would buy the line he is talking up the middle class. I can just imagine the conversation, "Mr Chang, I'm going to tax the life out of you so the middle class will prosper. By the way here is your receipt for the $1500 and thanks for the big donation to my father's foundation". Canadians tend to look at the US in disgust and the election of Trump. I think they do it to avoid the idiocy that is Ottawa.
She actually is a far left loony.  Chuckie Schumer, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are close seconds.
TRUMP = FRAUD
Nobody is worried about the Trump character. Cut the crap, dummy.  Except for  insane leftists lunatics like you and your friends - political hacks who are pretending to be journalists.
Does Cataluna get drunk before she writes this drivel?
Good riddance scum... Great Job Cheif Jewkes and staff.
White male, and your assumption is incorrect and rather insulting as well, as it should be obvious that what I wrote is intended to help as many as possible, and not perpetuate the cycle of death and rape inherent in the present situation.  As for the white privilege nonsense, spare me.  I'm not going to be unpacking invisible knapsacks any time soon.
The tRumpity Dumpity anti-christ nows not how to repent.  That's why he's the anti-christ.
the biggest rat moved to NDP
Pure BS.  Show some proof or take your conspiracy theories to some right-wing junk news site.
Legislators are a reflection of the voters. When they speak, what they say is your voice.  You might support this jerk buy many, including myself do not.   You are free to approve this fools comments as stating views you approve of. But stop trying to hide your support with a cover story about other issues being more imporatnt.
She is disingenuous at best and a liar at worst.  She must go.
I didn't say I was happy, there are still far too many ridiculous and reactionary comments here but there are few comments boards that have addressed that issue effectively.
This is plumb stupid!  If you know her name put it out there along with a picture.
WHY does it have to go to ala moana ?  This state is insane, they would not lose ridership, only current bus riders will be on the stupid thing anyway.
Now we can spend even more money on a worthless going nowhere project that our absolute liar-thief-con man of a governor wants to leave as his “legacy”. What a joke and an expensive one at that. This is NOT helping us get closer to new revenue and a sustainable budget. Get real people.
Liberalism is really a mental disorder.
"President Donald Trump’s racially fraught comments about a deadly neo-Nazi rally have thrust into the open..." What specifically did he say which was "racially fraught"? I'm not gonna waste my time reading the rest of this garbage.
And your comments to Hab fans mean nothing..  Stay in the Nation of losers.....
They can sneer all they want. Governor Walker is the only person with the guts of put forward a plan to get us out of this mess. All these legislators are just cowards and clowns.
Its a damn shame that people resort to bashing a man who is genuinely trying to do the right thing for our country and her citizens because they can't handle or control him. It just pisses them off that Trump won't play the puppet and is strong and relentless in getting things done his way. I'm sure they also realize that President Trumps fantastic work ethic and determination makes theirs look inadequate and incompetent. Keep doing what you're doing Mr. President. Eventually, those weak, scared, simpleminded, self-serving, unethical, and greedy haters will eventually asphyxiate on their own bullshit.
Not Islamo Facists.
Being a small minded and nasty person who is lacking in emotional and spiritual maturiyt and whose ministry is basically scamming gullible people out of money certainly strike me as disqualifications to the priesthood.  And I'd prefer that the right men (and sadly it is still only men) enter the priesthood rather than ordaining anything with a pulse.   We really don't need immature woman hating men who want to play Latin Mass dress up and act like little dictators becoming priests.  They do so much to chase people out of the Church.
Contraception is a sin for morons.
As someone who supports the president I find your comment about the KKK laughable as your ignorance on the subject.  It was the Democrats who supported the KKK, it was Democratic governors who would not allow blacks in the white schools.  Robert Byrd a Democrat Senator from West Virginia was a grand cleagle of the Klan. As far as Mr James another ignorant  democrat
What a load of crap! It astounds me that someone of this author's stature would go by the word of people who write for the NYT, that is known for peddling Putin bashing fake news. If Putin was such a tyrant and a strong arm dictator why would his ratings be the highest of ANY statesman currently AND is widely popular with his fellow compatriots? Also, the Crimea wasn't "annexed" but was legally taken back through an internatinally recognised referendum where 95% of the population voted to be incorporated back into the Russian Federatoon. If this author had done her research properly she would have known this and  discovered other real facts of the Russian Leader.  She selectively picks negative moments about Putin from the Oliver Stone interviews for the purposes of this article to fit her story in comparison to JZ the idiot. Had she done her homework properly she would also have learnt, thanks to Putin, that European and Asian countries are joining the SCO to improve trade relations.
Sanders said. “He was simply making a comment, making a joke, and it was nothing more than that.” The Donald made a joke? I doubt it. Not funny. I know he thinks he's funny with his funny hair, bigly red tie and tiny hands, but he's just pathetic. Believe me.
What cynical  garbage from a Liberal troll.  PR is by far the best alternate system. What you get in the percentage of the popular vote is what you get in th house. It's called real representative democracy. Not the dysfunctional crap we have now. NDP or no NDP. It's bigger than petty party politics Canadians deserve a better democracy than this.   The Liberals have blown a huge opportunity and will pay dearly with progressives who hold this issue dear. Liberals once agin prove than cannot be trusted.
Who exactly are the people dumb enough to not understand that by 'tax reform' the GOP means 'the rich pay less and the middle class and poor either get fewer government services or they pay more of the burden themselves...' I'd love to sell things to those idiots.... vacation timeshares or bridges in Brooklyn or reverse mortgages or maybe shares in the fastest growing buggy-whip business on earth.... they seem like REALLY smart people who know a good deal when they hear one
Joe_ six- pack What an incredibly inane and stupid comment to make.
anyone with a brain knows ignorant left wingers like you are just stupid
Wrong buster...many  decent American folk who believed in the integrity of the Senate just watched it be denigrated and perverted by poisonous Republican scum.
How big a fool does he takes us for?  He's above everyone else
Chrusty is corrupt.
Trump is clearly doing Putin's bidding.  Trump is advancing Putin's agenda.  Trump is a treasonous traitor.
That's because of trolls like you...
Come on people, we must have someone to remove this lying sack of snake shlt. There has to be a way to take the liebrals out of power before this bas--rd  destroys Canada.  There has to be some way to charge this turd with treason, maybe the whole damm liebral party. And you know what happens to a treasonist. Heck I'd pay 10,000.00 to have a  front row seat for the execution of that sentence.
Trump has long praised Canada's system and I think most Canadians would have to agree that, on balance, it has worked well for us. However, if I were an American I would be concerned about the idea of so significantly reducing the number of immigrants. Most economists and demographers would tell you that, to meet its targets for  economic growth, America needs many more immigrants, what with declining birth rates, massive deportations and entry level jobs going unfilled. And the limit of 50,000 refugees for a country as big and rich as the US is pathetic, not to mention dangerous
She is the worst. She if it doesn't involve the benefit of oil, gas, mining, or timber interests, Lisa just might as well not be there at all. DeVos is going to be a disaster for education in general and devastating to Alaskan schools. She has been a terrible Senator, both for Alaska and for the nation.
Stupid people doing stupid things, still doesn't mean that no one should own firearms. This sounds like a party of goobers who should have had supervision if they wanted to play with scissors. I hope that woman heals (I'll pray), what a BIG stooopid thing! Dancing with a gun you stupid tard? Why???!
Wow.  What a bummer.    General Kelly is either a bald faced liar, or sloppy beyond forgiveness.  In either case, the guy who's supposed to be the last barrier to Trump's devestation of the US and the world appears to be either morals-less, or incompetent.    We're in trouble.
No, they were traitors to the United States and founded their nation on white supremacy and slavery, and utterly rejected the principles of the DoI and the USC.
If you are dumb enough to want to live in freezing cold gynocentric socialist tax state: you're in!
He's a murderer. He's a murderer!!! He's a MURDERER!!!!!

What a jerk.
You are just all fussed up because of this allie:  Bombshell: Hillary Clinton, DNC Colluded With Russia In An Attempt To Steal The Election From Donald Trump!  It must be a real bummer for you to find out that Hillary is a crook like this, isn't it.
The 20th?  You mean the day that Trump's chosen group of anti-science, racists, bigots, and religious nutters can start screwing up the country?

The military is for protecting the Country, if you want to be a transgender, do it on your own dime.  We don't have time for people's mental illnesses in the military, unfortunately, the military is also a killing machine, MAGA!
Jimmy! OMG ! : (Obama's) support of Black Lives Matter - certainly controversial but not disgusting." Whaaat?!  Not disgusting to agree with "Kill the cops, fry em up like bacon", Etc. Etc. - oh yes, just Lovely comments.  He most certainly Was/IS an apologist for Muslim terrorists -just google it!
ha-ha. Hey Patuk, Wanna talk about rape? Let's bring up your candidate's husband. The silence is deafening. Dems are so great--rigging elections, dead people voting, lying, promoting racism (blm) & division. You're the real scum of the earth, so be careful casting stones.
Reichstag, fascism; you just can't help yourself. Anyone who cast a ballot or Mrs. Clinton is either a fool or a leftist; and I don't presume you as the former {though they are most certainly not mutually exclusive}. I'm not quite sure what you intend by linking Sanger's beliefs with the collection plate. It is Hillary who praises her, not Trump. Has anyone ever questioned her as to whether she believes it to be fine and dandy that black pre-borns are aborted at higher rates than whites or non-blacks?
Your darned right, it's more important. We have enough perverts and trudeau in my opinion is the worst. Come on 2019. These useless p.o.s. need to be removed and all this crap removed.
Idiot DimoRats chasing their tails.
' Stirring that pot of yours sure came to a tragic end for you, eh?  …that pot of yours has clabbered and congealed around way too many baseless assertions. . Now you just look silly standing there with a bunch of that congealed glop on the spoon in your hand. .
The majority got what they voted for in Obama, now they don't want Trump to fix it, so shut up and pay.
Were you the rube then? Actually you sound kind of like a boob!
This is absolutely disingenuous on Del Duca's part. But then again, I've always thought he was nothing more than an opportunistic, incompetent thin lipped weasel.

The world needs to explain how a liar, thief, grifter, immoral, foul-mouthed, sexual predator enabler got the Democrat nomination for POTUS.
She sounds utterly loathsome.

.  And the moron of mammoth/biblical proportions/Trump of course did NOT know the United States has binding treaties on nuclear arms with the Russians.  Just as the moron in chief does not know the United States is dead broke while the Russians are sitting on a 500 billion Heritage Fund, thus much better positioned to increase their nuclear weapons count.  Right? Is the man really that stupid? Really????!!!!  .
You should read what you wrote before posting. You sound like an idiot. So if it was a democrat operative tricking the trump campaign, why is this news now. Why was it not news when it mattered during election? Dumb people vote for trump. #logic
I read every comment about all of you on multiple websites, you have to be stupid to think people don't.
As someone who was brought up in a religious family with two christian preachers, my life turned around for the better and I became a real productive member of society when I went to community college and gained job skills. You call me a loser but in fact you don't even know who you're talking to except someone who doesn't share your point of view. The problem with religious actions like this is people wasting all that energy and resources on something that is not even real! So that is why I say pathetic- someone trying but failing majorly to do any good.  And bronze age zombie jew- welp, those are just facts. Except zombies aren't real! (Some might say ancient desert tribe with no knowledge of how reality works, rather than bronze age, but I don't think that's what you are really attempting to dispute.) When you perceive reality as a slur, you need to examine your beliefs. I suggest doing what Descartes did- doubt all that you believe to be true, *everything*.
I would call this man a complete idiot but I am not sure he is even complete. He has yet to accomplish anything except demonstrating how his size 11 shoes fit into his tangerine coloured mouth. However there is nothing wrong that a haircut and a lobotomy can't fix. We need one of those guys with three names right about now.......hope you can figure that out.
Wake up Wavemaking fool there is no need to tax the people of Alaska ...lets sell our land to create new wealth in the private sector.  Have an idea will you
Said the pot calling the kettle black.  Really Bauer?  Oh wait.  You're part of that crowd following that yellow-orange character sitting in the White House clown car.
It's because they lack the intelligence to recognise they are self-identifying as knee-jerk bigots, or just trolls.
So glad I'm not one of these "Christians."  They knowingly support a constant liar, bigot, and unrepentant sex-offender. It undermines any actual religious message they might promote.   Unlike the mainstream denominations, they seem to have little to offer except congratulating themselves on their righteuosness and damning others for the way they were born.
Yes the antifas are a bunch of juvenile half-wits running around smashing windows.  But there are a lot of them, and they are creating a lot of destructive violence.  The fringe right is a much much smaller group of idiots spouting garbage and who get zero support from 99.5% of Trump supporters. For the most part they are harmless and ignored.  To suggest every one potesting the removal of the statues is explicitly supporting white nationalist 100% is completely irresponsible of the Globe & Mail.  The small right fringe is generally less violent than the much larger fringe left, and yes the right fringe are reprehensible and should be squashed.  But what angers the right is when MSM tries to pretend that Trump and every one of his supporters supports the extreme.  Just because someone is anti Trump I don't assume he is an ISIS supporter who believes in wiping the world of all non Muslims.
Yep, Canada's drivers are terrible - and I'm talking about spoilt, long-term Canadians, not recent arrivals. Americans are much better drivers. So are Europeans and Japanese.
Yep. That darned Raygun. We are still dealing with the aftermath and the destruction of the radical ideology he and his gang brought to fruition.
I find it difficult to give the benefit of the doubt to a man who makes bigoted, sexist and ignorant remarks during his campaign.
Gee. I wonder what could have happened between then and now to make Obama change his mind? Could it perhaps be the story we're all talking about now?  You really think Obama would have let his daughter intern there if he had known Weinstein was a sexual predator?  What a silly comment.
Poor wittle fat boy soiled his Depends  n he's miserable..
What an out of touch, idiotic, lying, blowhard.  Our country will never be able to head in the right direction if he doesn't quit lying to himself and subsequently to the people.  Trump needs to recognize that America is not his corporation and he is no longer surrounded by "yes" men who stroke his ego.  This country belongs to 330 million people who are supposed to have equal say.  He is not a king and needs to stop acting like it. Oh, and the only thing exploding is his joke of a Presidency.
another ignorant loser of dumb, no loser the CTC supports government but only the leanest more efficient cost in government and gov that stays out of things they have no place being involved in,, typcially your an idiot, the public sector these days makes MORE than the same in the private sector! you hate facts from the CTC, a typical which means you are a typical leech living of OUR taxes...
I pass by this place to and from work every day and noticed the new art this morning! Hopefully, Lars Larson won't get wind of this. He and his Trump-sucking listeners all have a major hard-on for murals of Black men.
To start...ADN should stop (or at least significantly reduce) reprinting NYT/WAPO articles. For the crazies who are interested in reading that trash (along with the National Enquirer) they can go to the original source.
Yes, but Cubans get automatic legal status just for reaching the shore, which makes Marco Rubio one of the biggest hypocrites on the planet.

When the liar KellyAnne ConJob confronts Stephanopoulos, she is out of his 'intelligence league' by about forty IQ points. She is clearly ranked between a rock and a flatworm.

Nat Hertz says : "But he doesn't appear to have much company in his hatred of an income tax"....  Hey Nat, 60% of Alaskans do not want an income tax (source: Rasmuson Foundation’s Plan4Alaska poll, 2016)...   lies, damn lies, and the ADN
What a stupid and/or misleading comment.  Harper chose to work in the real world as a mail room clerk when he was 18 before deciding what academic and career stream to pursue.  Unlike your hero the snowboard instructor and part time drama teacher who has zero accomplishments for the first 20 years of his adult life, Harper then earned an honours economics degree and later a masters, became chief of staff for senior Calgary MP, later the first chief of staff for the first Reform Party MP, later the director of policy development for Reform, later an MP and then president of a national citizens political advocacy group with some 50,000 members, etc., etc.  You brag about having three degrees but when you make the ridiculous attempts to equate Trust Fund Trudeau`s anorexic resume with Harper`s you certainly make many of us skeptical about your academic background.  Clearly, research and logic were not part of your degrees program.
lol, just love the Donald.  So much fun.  Come on Donald, why should we believe you are more credible than the old FBI director?  Now if you had released your tax returns and pushed for a single pay health care plan in stead of that pathetic house plan, I might coniser what you say.  But as it stands now, you have below zero credibility.  You are little more than a Liar in Chief.  You should get help for your compulsive lying.
Two lives wasted for the most idiotic reason possible.
ITS THEIR MONEY paid for insurance that was over charged clearly!,, see its a government mandated fee not some service they chose to buy,, god you lunatics never think money is anyones but governments!
TDM, why do you post with so many puppet account, and like your own posts with puppet accounts, and add multiple disapproving ratings to people's comments you don't like by use of multiple puppet accounts? You even sometimes quote your puppet accounts and pretend to be someone else having an agreeable discussion with yourself. Don't you find that all, you know, pathetic?
Yeah instead they should let some dumb hick or burned out crack head beat the shit out of the women their with.
I noticed that Brad Trost’s wife Gerelt, who is from Mongolia, wrote a letter to the Globe, protesting her husband being called a racist by Knox. He obviously doesn’t have anything against Asians.  Bill Clinton was the only president of the US whose penis was described in court proceedings while he was in office,  possibly the only leader of any country. Really hard to fathom why Knox would have wanted to give this vicious, sexual predator and his rebarbative slut-shaming wife a third term in the White House. Thank God she and her accomplices didn’t succeed.
The Current occupant of the white house is a Pathological Narcissist/Sociopath who is mendacious and a threat to all. His speech to the UN was an utter disgrace.
Right on Right outrage. Bolling's son sounds like he was a piece of shit (apple doesn't fall far from the tree).
wrong.................Trump was a aberration
What does having a free and strong press have to do with barring a habitual liar from a a news program? The news is for passing on information to the audience, not outright lies masquerading as factual information, under the guise of legimate news, via legitimate news media.  I am certainly not interested in watching someone like Conway spin and spout her propaganda the entire time she's on television.  If she wants to do that, she should buy ad time. The news is for news, not to provide a platform for anyone's propaganda machine. Why should the audience have to wade through a cesspool of deliberate deceit to find out what their Presdent is really doing?  Ludicrous.
Actually, the Mayor of San Juan is a more experienced elected official and public servant than Donald J. Trump. She held her first press conference on the afternoon of the hurricane after herself having accompanied City officials making preliminary assessments of the damage, and specifically addressed the total obliteration of the housing built along the Martin Pena Canal. She is absolutely right in pointing out that the island is only 100 miles by 35 miles, and that by now, basic relief supplies (water, fuel, food) could and should have reached any point on the island by appropriately sized military helicopter. She is showing better, smarter leadership than the thin skinned, sociopathic Trump.
Nothing new....do as I say, not as I do.  The narcissistic buffoon has no shame.  Others would learn some humility, but not him.
"Trump is acting like such a loser...."  Acting?
The current occupant of the Oval Office has a long history of stiffing his contractors.  Every day he's benefiting financially from his position, something our Constitution explicitly enjoins.  He has zero moral authority.    It's easy for a rich money grubber to claim he's not beholden to anyone.  (He also pretends to give to charity, even though the money he passes along from his foundation was actually given by others.)    At least the Kochs, rapacious and uncaring fat cats, don't make any claims to represent the "little guy".  Drumpf, on the other hand, is nothing but an opportunistic narcissist and hypocrite.
True, but not as much as the shitheads who pack illegals into a hot trailer and drive them to their deaths.  I have driven for hire and I ALWAYS knew my cargo, as you are required to have shipping papers/bill of lading for what you are transporting.  I was hauling explosives, and radioactive materials, so I know what is required.  This driver was a human smuggler.  He knew what his cargo was. HE AND THE COMPANY HE WORKED FOR IS RESPONSIBLE.  PERIOD.
Every business that man has touched has failed and yet he has taken money from people to make himself filthy rich.   You don't think he would be okay with those bonuses only shows you are part of the problem and not the solution.   We are fools to keep thinking either the cons or libs will make the necessary changes.
Traitorous and cowardly leftists are perfectly fine with this.
Big deal the blazers suck because their management sucks and has since 1975. Dave Twardzic coulda made this team. Lillard is a one man show and Terry Schott should be selling ladies shoes at Nordstrom.
Sour grapes, McCarthyism and hypocrisy.
Investing in infrastructure is one thing building stupid emx does not do anything except line certain people s pockets and monuments to the bureaucrats that support idiot projects . It's a shame that ltd cannot figure out that a good bus system services the most people, fits in with the current highway system with the least impact on a community and doesn't close down many routs every time there is a recession when people actually need a bus service. The best thing that could happen is to stop the idiocy of the emx boondoggles. Keep writing to Trump like I do bringing the waste and mismanagement of ltd to the president's attention. I would like to see the feds use ltd as an example of how to waste those free federal dollars.
The mayor of Charlottesville stood by and LET this happen, then they say its Trumps fault??  Who's fault was it when BLM was sniping / killing police officers while obame sat quietly, and said nothing?  Was that Trump too?  What is wrong with these people??????  They really do think were all THAT stupid.
Hilarious.......stupid but hilarious!!!!
agree..that is how we ended up with the clownish and corrupt Kealoha.
It's amazing the mental gymnastics you go through to justify your racist bigotry.
Crowd funding is inherintly a good idea.   Too many lazy, irresponsible people use it for dumb reasons..  funeral expenses, travel expenses, etc..
OK. Let's play a game of "find the Russian trolls on this comment board" or "Where's Waldinsky".
Racist's have to work hard at it as a slew of deplorable, uneducated miscreants with hateful thoughts in following their "cheeto face von clownstick and a handful of deplorable miscreants,". Racism sucks and you're quite skilled at it.
As long as these donkeys keep getting caught I am euphoric (not from dope of course). The level of stupidity with these transporters is mind boggling. But as long as they keep passing that employment intelligence test they'll be hired. Who would have thought that you could shoot up Loctite?
The stupid, it burns.
I'm certain you can't teach me any history. You demonstrated as much by your ignorant comment.
Stupid Democrats and their media whores. Or is it the other way around?
Pathetic situation.
A few have, but not Roberts, Alito, Kennedy, Breyer, Ginsburg, Kagan or Sotomayor. Privacy is bound in precedent and the body of law on it has grown to the point that it cannot be reversed.  Thomas argues that the Court could change the terms of Chapter X of Roe and set an earlier time for the start of life. Gorsuch will likely go with Kennedy.  If Congress acted, it would not change much and would essentially ratify the current law, with some possible protection for Downs babies (probably not, however).  I wish they would - it wound end the issue and its usefulness in putting idiots like Trump and Bush in office. (at least Laura Bush had the last laugh, her husbands appointees vote with Kennedy on abortion).
I think he's got sloth covered pretty well. Look at this lump of hideousness. Does he even know anything about the policies he's advocating? His pathological lack of empathy aside, does he have any idea or spend any time trying to get an idea of the actual ramifications of his ridiculous policy suggestions? No. Everyone on Capitol Hill laughs at him behind his back (except the people who worship him, and these people are irredeemably corrupt) as though he's some idiot that got into his job position because his dad knew someone. Trump has always been reluctant to work an honest day's work that's why he CHEATS at everything he does. This guy hasn't worked an honest day in his life. The question is why do Americans allow such a person to occupy the most hallowed position in their society? The answer: they have deplorably low standards for themselves and their children.  They are evidently an abject people.
because when you do some dumb thing with an animal..a) you might get attacked and hurt bad….b) then in most cases the animal gets shot by Wildlife guys…. instead of the Moron!!! Go figure…are you getting the picture or do you get off on the unpredictablility and don't care about the fate of the wildlife!!!
So young and stupid!
Clearly Trump cares, or he wouldn't of commented.  And Meryl didn't even mention his name.    Trump is acting like such a loser....
agree.  Trump is playing games to play to his ignorant base.  He knows he can dupe them easily.  Terorrists are NOT coming through legal immigration.  A handful are already here and are American citizens.
...(cont'd from above)...   John O’Donnell, former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, quoted Trump’s criticism of a black accountant in his 1989 book: "Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day…I think that the guy is lazy. And it’s probably not his fault, because laziness is a trait in blacks. It really is, I believe that. It’s not anything they can control.”   Trump played a big role in pushing false rumors that Obama — the country’s first black president — was not born in the US. He even sent investigators to Hawaii to look into Obama's birth certificate.  Trump has repeatedly referred to Mexican immigrants as “criminals” and “rapists”, plans to build a border wall & force Mexico to pay for it, repeatedly referred to Senator Elizabeth Warren as “Pocahontas” due to her Cherokee ancestry, called for a complete ban on all Muslims entering the US  (cont'd below)....
Raitt's attacks might take a lot of gall, but not as much gall as you coming here to spout your typical HDS bile. Funny that you bring up Lac Megantic, which perhaps might not have occurred if pipelines existed to transport oil across this country. Your hypocrisy knows no bounds!
Hillary was on the Watergate Committee 30 years ago & a Democrat was the chairman of the committee; he discovered that his then young colleague was fabricating a story regarding evidence. He refused to give her a recommendation because of her lies. What's new? She is still the same despicable, corrupt, self serving buffoon as before; bitch belongs in Leavenworth.
David Brooks the original Israel firster and hater of America ... go crawl  back under the rock you crawled out of
how do you know that people at the 'next weekend market' , saturday market?, don't ALREADY walk around  with a joint or two up their bum?   and any eating of pot? WHAT? you must be out of your mind!
This pathetic article even contradicts itself saying FOUR children were BORN in captivity but later reporting that Boyle said there had been an abortion. Useless media can't keep anything straight.
The Mayor's an idiot.
An excellent example of if you won't police yourself, we'll have to do it for you.  What kind of idiot is watching internet porn on a public computer in the library?  These misfits need to be shipped to California.
What a pathetic post! My degree is in math. Math has nothing to do with running deficits or not, just in estimating their size. There are good reasons for running deficits as there are good reasons for businesses to go into debt to finance future growth and, believe me, CFOs can do math!
Great letter.  Reichert has lost his last small bit of sensibility.  His support of Trump has him talking like Trump, actually believing the nonsense that he spews from his mouth.  He has become a puppet and can no longer do his job.
Do you ever stop to think that government subsidizes tobacco growers with tens of millions of taxpayer dollars every year? You don't have to be ignorant or stupid to make a comment like yours, but it sure helps.
Hypocrite BUFFOON
Poor baby.   Tears of a clown.
The same terms "malignancy on the Presidency" were used during Watergate.  Would someone inform this little troll that that B.S. worked 45 years ago.  Try some other method to discrediting a Republican President.  Fool me once  -- etc.  The entire MSM and TV News licked Obama's boots for 8 years while scandal after scandal was covered up by the DOJ with their enablers in the MSM.    Even while Obama investigated and illegally surveilled some media members the bulk of these creeps still supported his criminal activities and utilization of government agencies to batter his political opponents.  He and his crew were the  worst criminals ever to occupy the W.H.  History will not be kind to Obama when the research and exposures are written.  He took advice from a known slumlord and crooked operator.  Ms Jarrett was his brain.  Problem is she was as dumb as a box of rocks and knew nothing about government or foreign policy.  The power behind the throne was a nitwit.
Everybody knew this was just another lie the moment Trump first tweeted it. Trump is a pathological liar. He lies as naturally and effortlessly as most folks breathe.
Drink Beer.... Only an Idiot does that.   The Food Babe had all the Brands Analyzed. Something very interesting was found! Airplane Deicing Agent (Propylene Glycol) is just one of the Bad Ingredients and It's Not Natural to Beer Making. Oh there is more than this if you care read the Article. The Food Babe contacted The Beer Companies and guess what... THEY wouldn't Talk to her about the Finding from the Analysis...   The Name should have been, ""Death in a Bottle""... Remember the FDA does not control Alcohol Beverages, The Treasury does that...  If this is in Beer then it's in Wine and all the Liquors...even those imported to the USA.  My sons read that Article, that was the end of their drinking... now they want touch the Stuff.
Pardon me if I do not share the editorial board's amusement at Trudeau 2.0's arrogant, stubborn, authoritarian and excruciatingly embarrassing performance in the House last Wednesday.  In conjunction with attempts to change the electoral system to ensure  perpetual power for the Liberals (preferential balloting),  to muzzle parliamentary debate (motion 6) and to marginalize parliament (making it a four day a week with over a dozen weeks off institution and freeing the PM to get away with just 45 minutes a week in the chambre), the PM's outright and brazen refusal to provide any relevant, substantive answers to opposition questions that reached its pinnacle last week. is infuriating and worrisome rather than amusing to me.  It is the kind of thing that is usually more associated with regimes like the ones in Venezuela, Zimbabwe,  North Korea  and with two of Trudeau's personal favourites China and Cuba than with Canada.  But it is not funny.
Kid's name like "Martyr"? Once married to Zaydan? Religious fanatic.  This family is beyond stupid. They are only victims because of Joshua  Sadly, Joshua's statement is a trial balloon for a future GoFundMe effort or some kind of Government "handout". This a deeply troubled human being. Don't give anything to this family.   Joshua was a staunch supporter of Omar. Therefore, Omar can share some of his ill gotten wealth in return
The President is a paranoid psychotic.  This from the Wall Street Journal - Mr. Trump "clings to his assertion like a drunk to an empty gin bottle, rolling out his press spokesman to make more dubious claims."  WSJ is being too kind.  Trump's approval rating, and his support in Congress, will continue the ongoing collapse.
How bout the people that want to drive slower not speed up to 75 when there is a passing lane. AND! If you are holding up traffic pull over! It is ridiculous to slow down to 40mph to see a damn dall sheep. It's not a matter of speeding on this road it people not pulling over when they should
Using his dad as an excuse, please.  The excuse is that he's a knucklehead.
The #MuslimBan is racist.  There is no rational basis for it and you are demeaning people by suggesting stereotypes.  You are suggesting ugly things about Islam despite the fact that I can point equally ugly things in the Bible.  Real people are getting hurt by Trump and his policies and his racist supporters.  There is a climate of hate that is being justified in this country and the innocent are paying the price because some uneducated white bullies in PA think that it is okay to hurt others because their own lives suck.
Nice foreign policy platform. 400,000 Syrian deaths...of no importance or value to this piece of trash.
In order to be funny you need a fool to ridicule. No matter how much you hated Obama and his politics he didn't run around hiring fools and saying moronic crap like Trump and Bush...
Actually, it is the perfect time to show all Canadians what a useless tool we have for a PM, call out the clowns.
It is the Donald that is so upset.  I am just sitting back and enjoying the show.  This is better than professional wrestling.  lol  You poor Trump supporters.  You now have to defend this clown along with his Russian corruption.
You guys are hilarious. You read an article filled with evidence that contradicts Trump's brazen bs and all you have to say is that they're lying? You just sound silly and childish unless you can produce a counter-argument supported by (gasp) facts.
The funniest part of all this is that it only confirms just how stupid Kaneshiro is -- that he didn't see this POS story he told -- meant to help cover up for Katherine Kealoha -- coming back on him at some point in the future.    What voters of this county should be asking themselves is "What is wrong with us that we keep electing the same moronic machine politicians to office??"
Carl Bernstein is known as a malicious left-wing schmuck.
No she isn't naive Shes a apparatchik working for the camp counselor trolling the G@M pages.  Also, other than Ottawa apparatchiks there are very few real people here. Mostly computer algos that respond in milliseconds with dislikes, frowns, and then this nonsense
Hatred towards the Klan and other right assholes is completely justified. You weak minded small penis loud mouths preach violence and commit it-daily-and you have help from the police. So, shit the fuck up Dan you piece of privileged shit
your excuse making for liberal stupidity and bad policy is what is off base
Comprehensive auditors are internal auditors and thus management;  hardly union reps. You are advertising your ignorance. Both the union drivers and the consumers have to walk over the same snow banks. Not all customers belong to unions.
You would have to be a fool to be a spy in Russia.
The President is an enemy of the arts (except of course oversized portraits of himself that he is so fond of buying with his foundation's money) so it's no surprise that the Kennedy Center management would want him to avoid the Center.  Trump is an imbecile.  Imbeciles usually don't celebrate the arts and artists.
No it's because we truly have an idiot for a president.
Regardless of why he did it, Beaudoin did the proper thing.  Now let's see how greedy the other "executives" are or if they feel they are "worthy" of such an obscene increase .and just keep feeding from the trough.  Maybe the Board members who granted the CE his increase should be scrutinized as well.  Wonder if their heads are also in the trough slopping up what they can while they can?   Greedy pigs is an appropriate label.
Where are all the dingdings who thought the punk arrested a few years ago for the same thing was some sort of folk hero? Utterly stupid. Thank you perez for this. The perp should be painted , and hung upside down fir a day. Everybody would be welcome to hock a loogey on him.
dirty old _____`s
Yes, because as ignorant as Bozo is, many of his supporters are even more so. He's the poster boy for bullying, loudmouth know-nothing snowflakes in this country.    They think that is a path to success, forgetting the only reason we even know about fat lil Donnie: he was born rich.
Considering Trump lies 60% of the time, the news must be real until proven otherwise.  The man is a serial liar and a con artist.  He preys on the weak minded.
Rep "Willow-cow-ski" (this is for you out their that can't pronounce his name the way he spells it) entered a bill that Sen "Stoll-t-us" killed to stop per diem after the 90th day. Ok then...have any of the minority stopped collecting the dough? No...thought so. Conversely, no one should be surprised at the "killing the bill" by Bill Stoll-t-us. He has made a whole career down there. Twenty years a leg aide and the rest of the time in the legislature to a good retirement. Why do legislators "feign" surprise at each other actions. I guess they do think we are all morons and buy into this nonsense.
When I started work for the State of Oregon in 1998, part of the incoming indoctrination was a presentation about computers.  After discussing the Oregon Public Records Law, we were all told:  "Do not put anything on the computer that you don't want to see above the fold in the Oregonian."  (There were still big thick newspapers back then.)   When I was first granted a Security Clearance, part of the three-hour interview and briefing was to point out all the bad things that could happen to my country and to me personally if I revealed Classified information.    Everyone involved at the DNC (two Congresswomen in charge), Podesta, and Hillary have all had the same briefings or the equivalent.    Arrogance, hubris and stupidity were the main ingredients for this bit of political theater.
You are just plain nuts, maybe shell shocked, or something.....I know, you have been smoking that rocky mountain green.
Google has egg on their face. This just shows they do not monitor their network. Trump's election had Vladimir Putin as a major illegal campaign donator. Still Hillary Clinton ran a lame general election campaign. Trump may be a moron, but Clinton is a moron as well.
how could this be. they are fluffys bestest friends. The china ambassdor to canada said there was no such thing happening so fluffy and his unicorns approved the sale of one of canadas highest tech. firms  to them so they would not have to hack into it. CSIS and every other security agency recommanded against it to protect high tech defense laser related technolgy but anything for the chinese . crap they  will soon own canada
And the liberals in Juneau collecting daily per diem when they live in Juneau?? They are all crooked!
These rating probably aren't even right. Cry babies just want to try make it seem like they are making a difference. None of the players are kneeling to disrespect the flag or america. Do any of you idiots out there that want the nfl banned. Think about all the players who all ways stand and the players who have served before. The ones that help their communities and other charities. Want the nfl banned for the few players kneeling. When is probably less than 1% of the nfl kneeling. But you idiots think justice is nfl getting banned and all the players being out the job. Just seem so selfish and greedy that some people want that. Fuck all the players that stand that have served and that help out alot. They should all be out the job for the few the many shall pay. But of course greed is the american way.
It was a fishing expedition, silly.
Corruption and Stupidity There is no cure! Lock em up!
That any Catholic, Christian, or American would consider voting for a racist demagogue like Trump is shameful.
"If the law supposes that," said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands, "the law is a ass - a idiot". As HZ says, this is a very complex issue. Not only has it to do with suitably available land in the urban setting but has a lot to do with the unavailability of private land and title deeds in the rural setting. It is a problem of how we are structured as a society. We are broken in so many ways and it is always someone else's fault.  It comes from the colonial days and grew in the Apartheid space which now thrives in the BBBEE and AA arena. If we keep insisting we are apart and in need of different rules for a different skin colour we will continue to feed this complex monster.
However more often than not the result of these pregnancies is tax payers putting out excessive money for fatherless children in day care or worse. Sometimes its simply a case of stupidity, people having children they know full well they cannot afford because they believe it is their right....they are wrong.
There is a saying, "If you get in a fight with a PIG, you will get slop on you".  I will be the intelligent one here and I am NOT going to get in a fight with you, because I do NOT want your slop.
Nah, Trump is just a plain immature and narcissistic silly boy. Y'allus stupid to have voted for him even after you have seen his clownish behavior in the primaries and televised debates.
Derek Kilmer,  let me be the first to invite you to go to Iran with your hero Hillary, and stay for the bombing. Traitor.
It looks HIDEOUS and is another useless move by the city.  WOW such lolo's in office.
Trump is acting more and more like a despot-wannabe....or a spoiled rotten six-year-old, stomping his feet when he doesn't get his way.  In the meantime, cowardly republican congressmen continue to allow this ridiculous spectacle.  I guess they will go along with anything he wants so long as they can use him to achieve their goals.  Unfortunately, they don't know how to wield their power for the good of the people.

What steps did Harper take to recover in his 8 years?   Libs vs. Cons just makes us all stupid.   They are both in bed with the billionaire class.
Who appointed you to  determine who is contributing to the problem? Maybe you are by coddling people. The genesis of this situation is a sex offending drug merchant, not a sweet young mother and her waifs. Foolishness is not saintliness.
I completely agree that he has mental health issues. All terrorists obviously have mental health issues.  Plotting to mass murder women and children is proof of that fact.
This chin clown just wants his 15 mins of fame at the expense of the people of Hawaii! This loser has to go!! When it comes to common sense the Dems have none!!!
I see....so poorly educated person, regardless of his/her intelligence, is stupid by your standard, SE Slayer? Most of the 3rd World people must be stupid by your assessment? What a bigotry comment!!!
“In my opinion it’s trash and garbage,” Choy said. “Is there a way we can not spend $2 million on storing stuff and spend it on, I don’t know, buying plate lunches for these guys?”  Talk about a disconnect between what non-homeless people think the homeless care about, and what homeless people actually care about. A plate lunch is a short-term victory. Holding onto possessions when you don't even have a home is much more meaningful to a person. What's trash to one man is another man's treasure.
The saying " play stupid games, win stupid prizes " seems to apply here.
What a stupid fucking commenting system.
A controversial rat.
There's a little race for governor in Virginia, and human-weasel manimal Ed Gillespie is going full metal racist in his ads.     Dems always think that "the media" is somehow the preventive measure for this stuff, that when Republicans "go there" the wise old white men of the editorial pages will write sternly worded editorials denouncing them and it will backfire.  It doesn't work that way. Those old white men of the editorial pages are often pretty racist themselves, even if they are offended by "the tone." More than that, they just don't have the power and influence they once did.  Working the refs has value, but unlike baseball, there are no rules to this game.  We all have to step up and heap scorn on the racists, our scorn is all they deserve.
This article is a load of crap....  Another Fake News POLL!
Also missing, is making you squeal like a pig....
I seem to recall that there was a lie during the campaign that Clinton and Obama founded ISIS.  So why make another silly, false comment?
This is really stupid, on both sides. If you believe in freedom of expression, what some players are doing should be acceptable. On the other hand, short of treats of harm, people's responses are acceptable also. I personally believe the players should/could have chosen a better way of expressing their grievance. Choosing to sit for the anthem has meant that their issues have been lost in the emotion. BTW, I'm a veteran.
Uh huh. Then why don't you behave that way in the ADN comments section?  Your alleged "c'est la vie" attitude is nowhere to be found on this website. Where's your vaunted "personal integrity" here?  You sound like Trump at his ridiculous and incredibly embarrassing - for him and his cabinet - "Tell Me How Much You Worship Me" fake cabinet meeting.
Trump is an ugly speaking man - no question.  Tabloid entertainment in US whether acting under the guise of news media, reality tv, or talk shows, has lend itself to electing such a man to be President.  What I still cannot believe is how the Globe editors and journalist are in such denial that they are complicit in the ugliness.  First, since they are all in terribly declining business models, inflaming the situation to get viewership has been an absolute focus. Second, they are consumed with the subject at the expense of focusing on real issues and potential solutions and the pros and cons of those choices and solutions.   Doyle quoted "The Truth".  Here is the truth, the vast majority of us are discounting everything your saying since its just so one sided and never ending.    Trump behavior is ugly, the established Media's behavior is one sided = the combination is that both will be gone in four or five years.
Racist.
Lisa supports him because she is not all that bright, Sullivan because he is a tool, and Don Young because he is an undereducated senile fool.

Stupid place for a gun shop....? The name of the store is mountain view sports.....its not located IN mountain view........its located in south anchorage.......!?
Really? Do you know how many vegan animals have what you call canines?  No, you don't. You can't fix stupid.
Hopefully the GOP will hold Dem/media feet to the fire for their gross, bigoted hypocrisy in doing nothing but adore 0bama for 8 years but now treating Trump treasonously, but considering the GOP's history of cowardice & spinelessness, I won't hold my breath.
Is Trudeau & the Liberals on drugs or are they just stupid, the US will spoil any emissions success Canada has, The Trudeau Government is just throwing away tax payer money. I'm not religious but I may start prayer daily hoping some supreme being may give guidance to Trudeau & the Liberals. I think he must be trying to out do the mess his father made of Canada.
What our ignorant PM, Mad McCallum and stupid Liberal politicians going to say?  In fact, this is just beginning of historical and stupid mistakes...  Our country, our lives and our future generation in big danger. !  Canadians will never forgive the Selfish Politicians who keep inviting those unwanted immigrants, uncivilized refugees, criminals, swindlers and terrorists unnecessarily into Canada.  Canadians don't want any of those uncivilized refugees, religious radicals, terrorists, and strangers into our peaceful country.   We don’t want to allow and tolerate the destruction of our peaceful nation.  The TRAITORS should resign immediately and should go away with their monsters.  NO MORE EXCUSE!   We all Canadians have to protect our country, our lives, and our next generation.
The orange haired one has been proven as a liar.
Its Gonna cost alot more if  tens of thousands of consumers start accidentally dropping glass jars in your stores you greedy pigs.
Religious fools should not be listened too.
How stupid can Trump get?  There is zero reason to interfere with Venezuela.  Stay out!  Didn't trump promise his white base that the uSA would withdraw from unnecessary interventions around the world.?  America First?  Ummm...the base got taken again.
They forgot the citizens of Iowa.  "How stupid are the people of Iowa?" Trump asked, after wondering how Carson could have narrowly avoided stabbing a friend by hitting his belt buckle. "How stupid are the people of the country to believe this c--p?"
thank you sheeple for re-electing this no good, lying sack of... mayor again. thanks alot!
I still recall sixteen years ago when we made fun about how stupid and incompetent Bush  and Cheney were.  Then the WTC was destroyed, and then they lied their gullible nation into invading Iraq, then the American bodies started piling up ......... and fewer people were laughing.   Then their Republican policies destroyed the world economy ...... and nobody was laughing.
"Lee Cataluna's pseudonym"  Prove it or shut it.
I see Garrion Keillors ignorance is well on display here.   Or arrogance, there is a lot of that running around with those dumb enough to support hillary.
Are these the same scientist that were caught manipulating data to meet their agenda? Luckily they were stupid enough to put all that into emails that got hacked and released to everyone so that we could see their hypocrisy. If global warming goes away, they lose their funding. The fact alone that Al Gore, Obama, and Hillary Clinton are fervent supporters of the global warming hoax, and that only taxes will fix the problem is enough for many to be wary of their ultimate end  game.
This is a horrible idea, worst this year. Still hope, though, it is only late March. Lots of time for dumber ideas.
Screw you Bernstein. The President we elected is doing just fine. You will not take my vote.  Make some noise for Trump. We are under attack.
All leftists can do is insult. It is sad that you are so invested in socialism. Yes, global warming - wait that had to be changed to "climate change." Why was that? Michael Mann's "Hockey Stick" was debunked long ago. Phil Jones at the CRU and Climate-gate tried to hide the warming 1000 thousand years ago. Oops. But leftists happily drive around with their "Bernie 2016" stickers spewing carbon into the air. And does Bernie ride a horse to his rallies? A bunch of hypocrites.
Trump is a traitor. You are too, Kabooby.
This is getting ridiculous to air every minor allegation to ever have occurred. Maybe the media should start a Hollywood list of men who haven’t been accused of sexual harassment.   Or to make it even mildly interesting, document the victim’s retaliation.  Such as: “Movie Set Nobody Slaps Star in the Face for Pinching Buttocks (oh, and it happened thirty years ago)”
Whites never learn....you're making enemies with the world - Blacks (lives matter/cops killing innocent blacks), Browns (destroying entire region and creating chaos), Slav Russians (yeah, anglos dont really consider them part of their own, so...), Yellow (sending the navy as potential "PREEMPTIVE" strike; not allow China to take uninhabited atols, when white STOLE and KILLED other of their land). Whites should enslave all blacks in America or send them back to Africa (on the way throw them oveboard), Nuke the crap out of Middel East and keep their Oil. Nuke the Crap out of Yellow peril so you can not only have the Pacific Ocean as your backyard, you can have the Yellowman's backyard as well!
Yeah man.  We are all fuckwits. So keep on robbing us.  Of our money, and our rights.  But just wait. What goes around, comes around.
With a name like that and trying to pass fake money twice, leads me to think this man is a newcomer to the USA and was naive in our laws.  Either that or he is an idiot. Even then, you'd think he would be  smart enough not to push his luck.
(continuing) clans for generations.  The Swedes, Norwegians and Finnish are descendants of the Vikings.  Australia was settled/ conquered by convicts.  Cuba and Haiti were conquered by the Spanish and French, who exterminated the islanders living there.  Etc., Etc., etc.  Either you are naively ignorant of history,, or you just loathe America so much you don't care to be sincere in your criticism and argument.  Regardless, you are entitled to your opinion and have the freedom to bash this country, courtesy of the constitution and the Bill of Rights.  However you might bear in mind a quote from Mark twain, Better to keep your mouth closed and let people think you're a fool than to open it and remove all doubt.  Have a nice day.
The real issue is that Trump is a racist pussy-grabbing ignoramus who will set the world back 20 years at best. At worst we'll be at war with Russia.
What a crock of crap! You are clueless and need to look in the mirror!
In today's political climate, you can be labeled a racist simply for discussing race.  We've discussed race, poverty, the reasons for poverty,  the solutions, etc.  If she were to put her views out on Foxnews, she would be attacked as a crazy leftist hack and a whole lot of other things.  If I put my views out on the Huffington post, I would be called a racist.  Neither of those designations are true of either of us.  I'm in a bi-racial marriage!   Today, you can be labeled something simply because you hold a contrary view and it is easy to do that on the internet.  In person, face to face, I have only had one conversation with someone I would consider a racist.  It was at a Waffle House in Mississippi.  That guy was a sick puppy!
Obama gives his parting address and Trump lies to the US yet again. From the sublime to the ridiculous.
This jerk is an agent provocateur has multiple identities: Juan Cadavid (believed to be his true name), Sterling Abrade(s), Dorian Navidson and Johnny Benitez.  The LA Weekly is on to him. He pretends to be ANTIFA, a Marxist, and alt righter.  What's his schtick? Who is he really?
It was dumb, but not racist.  She hadn't taken a shower or used Dove YET. Fire your ad agency.
BET's version of Homer Simpson...totally worthless hack...
I wish she'd apologize for being incompetent, do us all a favor and resign, and then deport herself according to the same laws used to deport others guilty of the EXACT same immigration offences.
The new normal??? I agree with what Morrissey said: the elites make stupid policies and the people bear the risks.
yet its the lunatic lefties like you doing the lying,, while there is on this no evidence of anything illegal, NONE.. dear america, please ignore the hate filled brain washed left sheep here in canada, intelligent people here on the right understand the bs you have to live with by the lefty lunatics
This is sick. We're going to be full of degenerates.
If climate and weather go hand in hand, when it is zero and snowing, the climate is arctic? When it is a hundred degrees and dry, the climate is tropical desert? Odd and amusing things come from the minds of the ignorant.
Sticking with the true definition of 'strumpet', Taylor's had more unpaid whores and sluts than actual strumpets.  Strumpets have to be paid, don't you know?
This guy is worse than the crazy north Korean.
You've got to be a real cuck to get your jollies making more trouble for the families of incarcerated people.  The family didn't commit the crime.
What is sad about this whole affair is that Tanner told lie after lie, and one lame excuse after another.  Raging teenage hormones and lost love are common experiences, and not rational explanations for this heinous act.  What a pathetic loser.
We have known that for years but Trump and his silly Ed chief De Vos are handing the public treasury to these fake colleges.
And yet you cannot cite a Reality based website to back you up.  http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/csj-sjc/jsp-sjp/wd98_4-dt98_4/p4.html  All it took for one "legal CCP firearms owner" to shoot his daughter dead was for her to jump out and shout Boo as he and his wife got out of their car. They are a fearful lot, terrified really.  One of the rare firearm fatalities in Victoria in BC began with a dispute in a nightclub. The jerk who started it ran home and came back with a handgun.  In Vancouver a while back a nut with a gun kept flashing it while waiting in an nightclub lineup. Someone told him that was "not cool" and he shot them dead. Really not cool.
She admitted to burning the child! On more then one occasion she has had contact unsupervised with children, her own that was set at part of her probation and she has done this on multiple occasions. Maybe those who have allowed this should go to jail as well! Only a sick and twisted monster could harm a defensivless child!
The clown car of the Trump campaign rides roughshod over U.S. Diplomacy...
Trump sabotaging rightful and lawful healthcare opportunities for American citizens. More treasonous behavior from the fascist Trump. Impeach Trump now
BEYOND DISGUSTING that Justin Trudeau continues the total sell-out of Canadian 'democratic sovereignty' and resources to the Chinese Communist Central Authority.  How many Canadian businessmen are shelling out 1,500 renminbi at fundraisers for Chinese politicians in Beijing ...OOPS, no need because there are no real elections. Let's act like China which controls its money supply by having an off-shore renminbi and an on-shore renminbi.    Those participating in the offshore foreign exchange program can only participate in the onshore program  through Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (QFIIS) which are granted quotas to participate in onshore (in China) trading and investment.  China controls every cent coming into its country ... while sending LOADS of emissaries and funds into Canada to buy dim-witted 'democratic' politicians and resources in Canada's borderless 'democratic' nation.  HOW STUPID CAN CANADIAN POLITICIANS BE? $1,500 is chump change to millionaires & billionaires!
TROLL
These should have been grants, not loans. I worked in the office which went with this approach in 2008. The Contracting Officer should have said no (and is now retired) and the Head of Contracting Activity who should have pointed out this was a bad idea was reassigned. They were the idiots who let me go. Karma.
Such a nasty woman.
Every pond has a certain amount of scum and it sounds as if we have just heard from some of them.  Time to stand strong with our neighbours of all faiths and ethnicities.  .
Are you on the Nuggets payroll? You keep using the Warrior game as a gauge! This guy will not amount to 1 game difference in wins The Nuggets will  CONTINUE to SUCK until You and those like you STOP LYING TO the NUGGETS FANS.We draft bums while leaving players on the board. we sign STUPID free agents that only want the MONEY.We seem to want any WHITE PLAYERS we can get! is it due to our FAN BASE being 98% White? I don't mind WHITE PLAYERS OR EURO players but  draft the one's that CAN PLAY! UNTIL YOU CAN BE HONEST LIKE KIZLA, this team is and will be a FAILURE!
All:  Officer, that Marijuana, Meth, Heroin you found in my pocket is not mine.............I do not know how it got in there............Lets just BRAND STUPID on these people's foreheads....................
You're going to act like you don't know why this pardon is different. The pardon and why it's different is the topic of several days worth of national debate and you're going to pretend you can't decipher what has been discussed? It must be hard for you to be so very misinformed and unaware, …bumbling from misconception to misapprehension. Sucks to be you, eh?
The simple answer is nowhere. Been like that since 1990. The scum in South Africa far outweighs the good people.
Like the uneducated super pious Republican base do daily, like a mantra.  Thanks, Obama, for outing those pigs when they began ranting about birth certificates and now look away when Trump hires another favor to Putin.  Good Ol' Piggies party.
Pro-sharia fools are the primary threat.
Oh how wrong you are We are dripping nationalism  we simply haven''t bothered cause there never was a reason to Now that our country has been taken over by terrorists, deadbeats and radical left nut bars we have a reason  You will find that your idiotic commie voice will drowned out by the holler of common sense and reason. Oleary will absolutely wipe that twit off the map with our help. You and your ilk will run and hide in the universities or CBC and whine about the end of democracy.  Unlike you we just plod along until something pisses us off.  Trudeau pisses us off. That little weasel is a scammer. aka Khan etc.  When all is said and done Canadians do things quietly.  We will quietly do our business while CTV, CBC, and every other commie fake news outfit blabs about this and that.  BTW That Trudeau foundation smells like Lyin Hillary's foundation.  You buggers stole our country while we slept. We will simply take it back and wipe out the liberal once and for all
You're not a smart man, are you?
Liar In Chief
Kara-Murza is a wholly-owned property of vindictive failed oligarch Bill Browder  (pictured but not mentioned). These people are parasites.
This is ridiculous.  Paying for a hotel room is not a "gift."   We keep this up and we will never get anybody decent to run for office.  The kids should run the businesses and get off the transition team and out of everything else political.  That should be the end of it.
Wavey:  You a truly a piece of work!  That you believe the crap you espouse is amazing.
President Trump has been in office for 8 months. He had declared a disaster before the storm even hit PR.  I would put 100% blame on all the career politicians in Hawaii. 95% Dems.  They do NOTHING to help the residents here. You Liberals are INSANE !
Thanks for clearing up any question of whether you're an idiot.
Donald has mental issues and needs a full neurological exam, including an MRI of his brain.  He's incapable of doing the job because of his incompentence, thus watches hours of TV every day and spends time tweeting and retweeting idiotic and vulgar comments. What a mess Republicans have made.
Trudeau, his crew and his supporters are that dumb.....
Joshua Boyle brings a new meaning to the words irresponsible and stupid. Incredible  stupidity in all this story is his and only his.
Prison rape is an effective deterrent to stay out of prison. It is a part of prison life that very few prisoners escape. Whether or not I am happy about the Bundy Militia idiot gang getting prison raped will not have any effect on it's occurrence. So why not be happy that a bunch of thugs who disrupted America with an idiot plan.
This man sounds insane, totally lost it, classic case of Trump Derangement Syndrome. What could he possibly be thinking of to make such outrageous and ridiculous claims about the president? Does he have no clue as to how he looks and sounds when he is saying such patently false things? Does he think the American people are so stupid as to believe anything he is saying? Buy a vowel, a majority of Americans were not impressed and didn't support his efforts against President Nixon. Hounding a legitimately elected president out of office is nothing to be proud of, Carl Bernstein has not improved with age. He is still the same arrogant a-hole he has always been in the past.
Eliese, perhaps you 'owe' us an explanation of why the Democrats are backing a known liar,cheat and thief.
What is really quite ironic, and of course hypocritical, is the author's whining, slanted diatribe,  criticizing Fox for being biased, while ignoring the unprecedented  unprofessional, disgusting and fake news thrust upon any viewer on a daily basis, by the Clinton News Network, a.k.a. CNN. After a two month period in which to recover, this situation could only be the result of the MSM left-wing syndrome otherwise known as  "We still look like fools".
I wish Ige could put a muzzle on Chin and stop his 'tilting at windmills' on the taxpayers dime. It doesn't take a plethora of AG's to challenge Trump. We have far too many urgent problems in Hawaii, like our third world highways embarrassment, the homeless that I need to step around on sidewalks literally a few blocks away from the Capital and City Hall. Meanwhile, we can't even get competent professionals who can file timely applications for million$$ in grants for the needy. Hawaii is fast becoming a laughing stock and Chin is the most visible political clown.
"Justin Trudeau to stand up to Donald Trump"?  Where do these ridiculous polls originate?  Trudeau will do as he's told.
maybe somebody too stupid to make it as a petty criminal.
where are your BRAINS???????????
Dimms are lying sacks of excrement, grasping at straws in an attempt to revive their totalitarian agenda. Let them die off.
Kinder Morgan's pipeline is a stupid idea to start with, because there is no equipment to clean-up a toxic, tar sands spill. The tar sands are riddled with carcinogens. This stupid idea is an insult to the intelligence of the peoples of BC and WA. Let's keep beautiful BC and WA.
You're a coward who's afraid of getting in the arena so you stay in the stands where it's safe and throw bombs at the competitors in the arena.  Coward, fraud, liar...just a flea trying to eat an elephant.  Please find something where you can get in the arena and engage.
The KKK, Nazis are a created boogyman. The KKK has been almost nonexistent for 50 years. I have seen them try to organize in central Ca. In the 1920s, we were the largest KKK membership west of the Mason Dixen. A few organizers would show up, mostly dope heads, convicts, cops at all levels taking notes. Great gathering of morons. Threat, unless a stop and rob, zero. Nazis, never seen them, central Ca. , bikers, most leave civilians alone. Other than Socialist/ communist organizers praying on college students, drug addicts, I don't see a problem.
Reminding adults to be responsive to hate speech and actions just might keep your fat, four-eyed, rag-tag, stammering, effeminate son or buldyke daughter from being harassed at school.  I don't understand the objections.
That Nenshi guy is just sickening.   He did one of the worst most degenerate things I have ever heard a public official do:  sent known criminals to try to infliltrate the Uber driver group to prove how bad Uber is, with NO CARE at all that if successful these criminals might pose a risk to passengers.   Nenshi belongs in jail, not in office.
You like em' gay, drugged and commie eh? Real civil post, but I see no one took it down!  Your not even fit toe shine their shoes! lol
Idiot paid the price of speeding. I see lot's of idiots going through all the tunnels at high speeds in both directions. What's the saying 'they probably late for their funeral'.
Play stupid games and win Hollow point prizes .
Wow, finally an insider gives us the dope. Pray tell, can you inform us where you got this information from or are you just making stupid accusations? We are all waiting for your response.
If you want to see Alaska sink further into the abyss and become absolutely irrelevant in the US Senate elect Miller, You'll be sorry. The only way to stop stupid is to first stop acting stupid.
If Hillary won because Putin helped her to win people would be talking about it. You didn't vote for Trump because of Putin, you voted for Trump because you're a dolt. But now you have no excuse for your disloyalty to your country and your loyalty to a foreign dictator. Your embrace of another country's leader directing the U.S. government through blackmail of the traitor Trump is evidently a conscious choice on your part. You won't be bragging about having voted for Trump in five years time. I guarantee it. You'll lie about how you voted to everyone you know but, if you're honest to yourself, which you won't be, you'll know you were just one of many of America's version of the village idiot. There'll be many like you.
Vietnam reminds us how lying leaders were able to fob this manufactured war off on the American people.  It is a shameful event and America has never been the same since.
Read up liberals. You sensitive types are a little bit nuts
dirty liberals
Ms Clinton is a pathological liar.  Here's just a few of her whoppers ...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLtxm3v6KwY  She was also rabidly against gay marriage before she so conveniently was for it ...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83rQ7W0OrBM
as known racist, liar under oath, trumpunk opportunist, and avowed oppressionist AG Jeff Sessions says ''good people don't smoke marijuana''. see how stupid that type of limited reasoning sounds? ''Laws only keep good citizens straight. It does nothing to deter criminals.'' in the case of your grifter-in-chief and his fellow cons surrounding him you couldn't be more correct, but for the general public laws are deterrents and society benefits, the minority who break them stand to be busted. why am I not surprised it has to be explained?
well, dumb old chump is simply hell bent on pacifying the military industrial establishment by whatever means are at his disposal.
Junior is sooooo dumb.  How long can we endure this tree stump?  Trump will chew him up at NAFTA negotiations.  Canadians are going to be huge losers.
Nice threat.  Actually these cowardly losers were carrying tiki torches.  A bunch of snowflakes.  So scary!
Ukraine is on the front lines against Russian imperialism. Arm the Ukrainians with defensive weaponry and they will help preserve Europe against the neo-fascist regime of the KGB clown in the Kremlin.
Pathetic. Seasons's over.
Because no one who rides a bike doesn't own or rent in this city, thereby paying property taxes directly or indirectly.   Not a single cyclist pays income tax. They don't frequent Oregon businesses at all.    What are the benefits of bikes on the roads.  Less space taken up, more room for those who do want to drive, less congestion.  Less damage to the roads one person on a bike certainly produces less damage than a person in a car.  Less air pollution.  Better health thereby lowering the cost of healthcare for all.  Those damn cyclists just costing us money left and right.
I agree with 57219. And what about the points? What kind of friend lets 2 to 4 points go on the owners driving record because the borrower of the car is a lame ass idiot who cant or wont stop at a red light?
German democrazy will retire witch merkel soon.
None of us here find the press (or you) funny. And Obama's roasting of Trump was an abuse of his office, childish, immature and reflective of his narcissistic personality.
your a full of crap bs liar, no conservative,, no business pays on the needs of anyone they pay on what the market will allow a business to retain people and still make a profit! .. there is no such thing as your bs fantasy thinks,, why not pay 100 an hour then bud !!!! ALL WILL BE GREAT IN YOUR IGNORANT MIND
I would say having sex in the Oval Office with someone other than your wife is moronic. Also, how many crossed red lines, with no following reaction, does it take before it becomes moronic? North Korean policies under Clinton and Obama were so moronic that NK now has the bomb and ICBMs.
No, just the Donald.  He is the one who promised to release his tax returns but then changed his mind and lied to us.  What a bum.  What a liar.  What you say about Obama makes no sense.  But you mentioned Russia.  How do you like being allied with Putin, who worked to get the Donald elected?  Do you favor Russia's involvement in American elections?  Just imagine if it was Hillary who won and had Russian connections.  You republicans would be ballistic.    Drip...Drip...Drip...
It is long past time to recognize that rational people cannot interact meaningfully with the substantial numbers of irrational ones.  How do you talk to the majority of Trump supporters who believe his son did NOT have that meeting with the Russian lawyer, despite the admission he did and the provision of email documents to support it?  What do you say to the majority of Republicans who believe Obama is a Kenyan Muslim?  How do you seek to understand the worldview of people who believe in so many things that are absurdly ridiculous and have not a shred of evidence to support them?  The answer is - you don't.  You continue to label these people as stupid and their leaders and news sources (Breitbart and The Rebel come to mind) as stupid, because what else can you call it, really?  We have tried to "understand" the other side - it hasn't worked, because these folks do not think rationally.
... Cheetolini is a waste of human skin as is anyone that voted for him or supports him ... terrible human being
Enough with the free coverage in the pursuit of ratings. Trump is akin to an internet troll.  He thrives on outraged reactions.  If we ignore Trump he WILL go away.
Here's hoping the EPA and caring people everywhere can throw enough sticks in Pruitt's spokes to derail his Denier Cultural Revolution.  Harper did a lot of damage too, but apart from losing the time we are recovering pretty nicely from his dumb-and-proud Denier interval.
I feel bad for this kid who's moms either such an alcoholic, or crack head she's staying in the econo inn with many other dudes. did they all F^%$ his mom too? is she a whore? This kid had a bad childhood poor guys going to jail now
Loves to be appalled?  It's what concern trolls do.
Neil! You fool! I'm not saying BAN helmets. I'm saying make them mandatory, punishable with fines and jail time for not wearing one at all times! Have you seen the statistics on HEAD INJURIES & TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES? Obviously not! It's shocking to say the least and we just allow people to put themselves and others in harm's way by not legally requiring them to wear helmets. We need to protect people from themselves! I'm TRIGGERED by the fact you didn't even read my post & just started mansplaining to me! Sexist.
You're forgetting Congress has the power to disapprove and impeach the traitorous buffoon.
Where does an AssHole like you, get off telling someone they have no right owning a house in a city they were born in!? You, shouldn't have been born! Arrogant F###!!!!.
You are the cretin.
Julian should receive the Gold Star award from Russian intelligence for his role in attacking democracy and the Silver Rapist award  from Ecuador. I hope he rots.
Has anyone ever told you that you're a terrible comedy writer?  I can't be the first, can I?
Smirkonish is a pinhead.
Yikes... another self-hating liberal.  I say you guys start.
I would think Secretary Clinton would be a more accomplished liar considering how often she does it.  At the debate she showed just how dumb she thinks we all are when she said 17 intelligence agencies agree that Russia is behind the email leaks that are damaging her image.  What Clinton said was false and misleading. First of all, only two intelligence entities – the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) – have weighed in on this issue, not 17 intelligence agencies. And what they said was ambiguous about Russian involvement. And what they said was ambiguous about Russian involvement. . . . are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts.  Saying that they are consistent with other Russian-directed efforts is not the same that Russia is definitively behind it.
So the voters in Lac-Saint-Jean are "stupid"?
You're sick
Trump might want to learn there is an agreement called NAFTA which prohibits import tariffs on the three countries in it.  Until he cancels it, US companies have the right to import goods for Mexico tariff free and even if he cancels it, only congress can apply tariffs and most Republicans are still pro free trade.  It was Ronald Reagan who brought free trade and many Republicans identify more with him than Trump.  This is another dumb idea from Trump who is economically illiterate.
Trudeau, STOP spending our money for your own fucking benefit, mind your own fucking business.
I hope HPD arrests this loud mouth Espero one day.   He sticks his fat nose into everyone's business but hasn't done a single thing to address the crippling traffic in his district.  What a fraud!!!  Where's Bulaia when you need him. He would knock that Bolo head down a few notches.
you left wing idiots couldnt debate a kids birthday party without lying and making things up and attacking the messangers...,, again the deflection to harper is typical of leftys that have been exposed for the corruption and lies, lies like justin made for votes during the election where he clearly said “there should be no preferential access or appearance of preferential access” in exchange for political donations..
Because trump is so incompetent, thin-skinned and immature, he is easy to manipulate, as putin knows. Why so many Americans are so easily manipulated by this flim-flam man is a mystery to me.
POMPOUS MORON TRUMP IS A "BAD DEAL" FOR AMERICA
Why are US Presidents so stupid these days anyways ?  The Donald and Dubya.... puhhhh-lease !   Obama.... a vast improvement over the above two clowns, but an academic lightweight.  Merkel who holds a Ph. D. in Quantum Physics seems 10X smarter than these three men put together.
Super fakey bigot racist sexist 'christians' dont like to think too hard or deep ...
Are you able to contemplate the possibility that Brexit is an uncommonly stupid idea? . That it would be an uncommonly stupid idea, whether the press liked it or not?
And the dumb won , great.
Trump is obviously insane.  Adults do not act like this in the face of tragedy.  Everyone who voted for Trump should be ashamed of what they have done.  Worst President Ever.  No question about it.  History will be appropriately cruel to this spectacularly unfit ignoramus.
Read The Wall Street Journal article on the recent Senate Congressional hearing about this very issue, part of which I posted to Neko a few comments above.  Is climate change real science or not.  All the testimony is supportive of my reasons for opposing climate change from the beginning.  You and others are the ones who have bought into it without realizing you are being conned. God deserves better believers than that.    And yes, I did understand the analogy.  That is why I said "you are getting ridiculous."
No surprise before Dan Sullivan carpet bagged the Senate seat and then afterwards sits there like a coward in silence doing nothing for America or Alaska.
The State Stole half your dividends, and you all bent over and took it ! Our Politicians are crooks, but thanks for the article on applying for this year's handout!
And tonight we get to call him LOSER.
No, its not comedy. It's the highest form of idiocy!
I have to wonder why we have such an increase in crime this past year.  Is it because we don't have enough police and people actually think they'll get away with it?  Is it because of drug addictions? Gang activity?  Lack of jobs?  No decent health care?  Crummy wages?  Idiots for parents?  Escaping the law from the Lower 48?  Homelessness?
This is where Trump's dirty Denier lies will be given full play. And like a good fascist he will try to erase all truths he doesn't like. Like the sleazebag he is, he will probably claim he is just a useless "skeptic".  Actually this story proves that Harper 9 years ago was just as big of a right wing freak zealot as Trump, with his contempt for learning, his hatred of environmental protection and his dangerous irresponsible Denier stance.  Now we have finally gotten rid of Harpo, suddenly the Brad Walls and federal conservatives have a new Denier Hero.
and yet another stupid white man (as put by Bill Maher).  Why does the media have to point out (at least in the headline)  that the driver is Japanese?  Who the H cares?  Isn't he just a elite pro racing driver who happened to win the Indy 500?
" We voted against the lying, illegal, immoral activities of probably the worst person to ever step into American politics. "  Sorry, I thought you said you voted FOR lying, immoral Trump.
This has me so angry. We do not owe this terrorist 1 red cent. He and his family should be stripped of there Canadian citizenship and sent back to where weever they came from. I don't give a rats ass if he was born here or not. My dad served bravely in the navy and my father in law in Air Force WW2 what a slap in the face to them. Trudeau you are a national embarrassment
OK Then if it's so common, show us where the NRA is selling guns at all, let alone to "anyone who wants them."  Put up or shut up.
Who ordered the orange clown?????
FM:  Plenty of expierence that's why I read before I post.  Lighten up, bonehead!
The GOP is getting all it deserves for not accepting the best president America has ever had - Barack Obama. Everyone of them is saying the American presidency is for white men only. Preferably bigoted white men.
No there scared because their newly elected idiot leader is about to start a trade war that can't be won. Their afraid that their shares of their companies are going to tank and they will have a revolt because one idiot has access to twitter, They are afraid because China basically owns the US debt and they could bankrupt the US ... all because one megalomaniac can't control his 2 thumbs. What good are the nuclear stockpiles of the US when they can't be used and don't think for a moment countries don't know that.  The idiot at the helm is a political juvenile with a mental imbalance. He hasn't a clue of how the world works now and is intertwined. This isn't 1952 anymore and it's time Donald woke up to that reality. The fact is , that his blustering is meaningless because the world is quite aware of how things are now.
Why is Donald so concerned with what the Russian's think? He needs to know the entire world is laughing at him. The Russian's and everyone else find it amusing how Donald pushes his nose around Europe, and how this pathetic little man is crumbling..
The only thing malignant is that tumor you call a brain that makes you so stupid.
Actually, the best friend of Trump in this election cycle, is Hillary herself.  Anyone who has read what a nasty bitch she is in person, and her lying about everything, as well as criminal inclinations, will realize that she herself is the best reason to vote for Trump/Pence.
We’ve already heard all the ‘Fake News” from Fox, fair & balanced, lol. Obstruction, collusion and stupidity, it’s a coming, fellow Americans
Are you saying this woman is "street trash"? Did you watch the video or read her story? Your comment is about as dumb as it gets.
Oh please, get off your dead butt and do something other than blame the other guy.  I truly hope that come November you are looking for a real job.
Nurnie/Saullie: you are on mute, not interested in your foolishness!
Hey chief nitwit Move to North Korea with the rest we f your ilk.
Republic of Uranus, our favourite China Troll Please do us a favour , and crawl back in your hole
"“Suppose you were an idiot, and suppose you were a member of Congress; but I repeat myself.” Mark Twain."  Back in Twain's day that may have been correct. But fast forward to today and you have a Congress with a roughly 95% re-election rate(~10% approval rating). Who are the true idiots? The electorate, hands down.
And don't forget the periodic recessions over the life of the construction, devaluation of property values and the periodic weakening of the Yen, which impact Japanese tourist visits to here.  The Mayor's rosy projections all assume a straight growth projection.  Dumb!
The system needs to be fixed and fixed quickly.  The dems completely ruined health care in this state, aided by the idiots at the health administration in CO.  We now have 1, count 1, non-HMO plan available for individuals under age 20 that has a $7,200 deductible.  Yes, you read that correctly.   Thanks dems.
Filthy, violent regressives. Say they stand against hate. Oh sure, we all can see how "non hateful" you people are. Scumbags.
This article seems foolish.  It starts of talking about the negative affects off sports drinks and energy drinks (two different things) but then  appears to only give evidence why energy drinks are bad.  They are two very different things why are thy being  lumped together.
Its pathetic indeed.
This opinion is garbage.  Why?  Read how many times the author tells us May's motives.  He does not know May's motives.  Yet he proclaims them and builds his opinion around his projection of motive.  Circular and without content.
... damn straight cash is king in the USA... bigot bakers can suck daddy's big ol' ... ;)  May the USA be RID of 'christian' Republican racist sexist bigots ASAP these folks are holding the USA back!!!  I'll dance on their graves when they DIE!!
lol, yes tell me how the Donald is draining the swamp.  Meet the new swamp ten times as big as the old swamp.  If you are going to make a statement of the Donald draining the swamp, you better be prepared to show he is actually doing it.  lol  Fact is the Donald is the most corrupt president this country has ever seen.  He believes in ignoring the constitution although to be fair, he might not even know that it exixts.  He is mentally ill which just compounds the problem.     Keep on worrying about Hillary, I prefer  just reminding you phony conservatives what a joke your candidate has turned out to be.  Reagan must be spinning in his grave.  Who would have thought that GW would ever look so good?
His repulsiveness should be bipartisan, in my opinion. I don't want racist, lying sociopath, narcissists as my POTUS regardless of party.
Foolish Drumpf. Foolishness is bewailing its existence having to be used to describe this blight.
Not quite as powerful as stupidity, lying, and smugness, though.
Trump is a low life, draft dodging slimeball, and you're calling Senator McCain a coward?
He's someone who thinks you're pathetic.
So Obama, 10s of thousands of intelligence officers, and thousands of civil servants are all colluding together to lie to the american public and possibly start a war with Russia?  Despite many of these individuals being Republican?  NO ONE believes this - not even you.  Your comment is laughable as you surely know.
Sounds like an excellent book, in the style of James W. Loewen's significant social history of the US, "Lies My  Teacher Told Me. "  Today we see the righteous  anger the Middle Class directs toward the top 1%. for their bloated incomes.  Too often, however, Middle Class contempt  for the "White Trash" passes unnoticed.  While the MC  is sure  they themselves are as smart and hardworking as the rich, too often they assume the poor and unskilled workers are  just "dumb and lazy" and deserve to be on the bottom.    But a special note on Oregon:  yes, "Land was the principal source of wealth", so the free  land given to the first Oregon pioneers--640 acres for a  married couple-- spurred a frantic rush to Oregon and many formerly landless folks were able to acquire significant farm land...but at the expense of the Indians whose land this was.
There's no valor in paying income taxes without taking advantage of tax savings that the law provides.  Hillary implied that those who pay taxes are "stupid;" Trump just said that he was smart because he complied with the tax laws which resulted in his not OWING any taxes.   That just means that if you're paying, you're either stupid OR the loopholes in the tax code don't apply to you.  The latter is a problem with the tax code, not the income earner.
It looks like I hit a nerve as when it comes to ileagal drug users, I say let them die. Useless garbage.
I agree 100%. There's no reason whatsoever that a U.S. official should be allowed to do anything more than deny entry to their country.  We all know how the U.S. tends to go beyond what is reasonable-they are thugs in the first degree. The Harper government went overboard with this idea that U.S. officials should be armed on our soil and b) and c) ..Selling out sovereignty so a few trucks go across more quickly. Disgusting.
And it ignores the reality that currently and prior to the PPACA, costs were already being shifted.  Given federal law, anyone in an ER must be treated - this is paid for via taxes and higher costs to those who have insurance or pay out of pocket. One reasons for the PPACA was to address the prior cost structure; support hospitals in ER costs; prevention to reduce ER visits; mandate annual check ups; maternal care; etc. to reduce costs.  The proposed AHCA will not cover maternal, wellness, or mental health - stupid.
All smoke and mirrors, a lot talk and flash but nothing that actually gets done except pissing off our friends around the world, Trump is a con man using used car salesman talk, and apologize to used car salesman.  Trump and team know they can BS their supporters who are more reality TV type folks, easy to hoodwink.
What is the point of this article? It's as if you're hinting at something rather than being clear. As if to be explicit on what you are writing  would make the article ridiculous.
This is blatant disregard for rules and regulations. The ethics commissioner cannot rule on this, as  they are always biased. Criminal charges should be levied and the donations returned. Dirty Politics! Trudeau the hypocrite.
Your hypocrisy and bias is unbelievable.  That's exactly what we get from the right-wing crowd
The planners are punishing Eastmoreland for their neighborhood association's leadership on livability.  Robert McCullough is my hero- he takes care of the SE Uplift area, and helps residents of less fancy neighborhoods.  Hopefully Mayor Wheeler will clean house when it comes to our current group of city planners,  they are inept idealogues..
Stop with the "hero" nonsense.  This clown seems to have done little or nothing except show up to check on an exit door alarm.
Russia needs to employ more intelligent writers. You garbage is an embarrassment to your fellows in the Russia web brigade.
Kasich is an egotistical moron!  More absorbed with his own self importance than anything else.  I would vote for Donald Duck before I would vote for this loser!
Trudeau is too busy doing favors for communists to be bothered with what you and your ilk think. You voted for this moron and deserve this crap.  Canadians come last with this piece of garbage.
"The Court's leniency has had no positive effect and the defendant has clearly demonstrated himself to be a severe danger to the community," Carlson wrote."   No shit people!! This guy is a 3 time killer! We are lucky he got busted for dope and not more murders. We are all in danger when this guy is on the street. Lock this loser up and keep him locked up!! Judge Ray, how's that 2nd chance for this killer looking now? I will give the guy a pass for shooting at his dad in 2012, he was a very abusive parent. Abuse or not, he chooses his actions. No excuse for this sociopath.
Yes some conservative voters are that stupid.   Yes some Democrat voters are that stupid as well.  Indpendents too.    It will be interesting to see how voting goes.   Let's assume that people figure out what is in their best interest?    If you have a lot of discretionary spending money, great, this is going to reduce your price some because  low income sick people won't get offordable care.    These high earners tend to vote   (some would absolutely support single payer)  Then you have the lower incomes who have 3 choices: You accept higher payments; You accept  lower care levels/fewer visits; You don't have insurance.   Although you may be able to become poor enough to then qualify for medicaid.    These people tend not to vote.     It will be interesting.
Nor do they mention the b j in chief BILLY..nor mention the criminal foundation they run...ask the people of Haiti how much they adore them... The criminals that they are. Hillary stands by her men...bill and Harvey till... And Obama. Send me your sick send me your poor...send me your daughter...LOL.  And they did!  Sick, stick with the sickos
I believe it, but that's because I skipped a grade, graduated first in my class in college, and can remember that being a child didn't make me an imbecile. You?
next time give the Bastard some steaming hot beverage to the face!
Iv personally been to one of his partys hes a fucking creep and i was kiked out for protecting a 16year old drunk girl that he was trying to have sex with. She left with me and i got her on a bus to some where else. Dude belongs in jail let alone on the sex offender registrie. He took advantage of girls like that pile of shit mayor did to little ass boys. Ask me he deserves to be locked up.
What!?!?!?  Trump owes hundreds of millions of dollars - mostly to foreign banks, and has tons of business conflicts of interests.  Lawsuits have already been filed against him for violating US ethic laws  He's the dirtest president ever
`I can scarcely recall what I imagined the internet would bring when it bloomed a generation ago. But my speculation about an interconnected future did not include reading the real-time rage-tweets of a malevolent clown while he sits in the White House throne room, having been placed there by traitors, racists, misogynists and assorted goddamned nitwits. Nope. I did not see that coming.
Thats a big boost to my confidence, if it can be proven that he has a mind.  Mind you, so far that has been very difficult task, as he seems to have forgotten most of his election promises.  Then there are those mis-spokes and elbow gate didnt do anything to his manners.  But, he is smart enough to get plenty of free holidays, so maybe there is some tiny tiny semblance of cognitive ability.  Trumps not too bright but can he dumb down  that far...
"Time to check your Cishuman privilege"  Offensive transphobic shit.
As I watched the helecopter slowly make its way back into the valley through the rain and clouds (with the stretcher violently swinging underneath) I found myself holding my breath.  My thoughts immediately lept back to July 21, 1995 and I waited, for what seemed like hours, for the pilot to make his way back out.  I hope that young man realizes how lucky he his that the HFD pilots are so amazingly good and how being so stupid put more than just his life at risk.
The staggering hypocrisy of liberal bigots is only exceeded by their shameless intellectual bankruptcy.
Compared to the rest of the clown car cabinet, I will concede that he is something of an adult.  Nor does it even matter if he is an oil man.  The planet is doomed anyway.  Putin will doubtlessly give him another medal for helping things along.
NDP:  Idiots at play.
Boots>  It seems to me that you have it reversed, where it is surprising that people would vote for "crooked HRC."  As the latest in the real world, depicts a woman and a colored man sold out their country, for what apparent reason, did they do it for, huh????  The POTUS will be the POTUS, but how can you stand with criminals????  I just don't understand you, Boots, they made all of you look like a bunch of baboozes!!!!  Blind leading the blind, right????
Do you REALLY want people too lazy or too stupid to walk and chew gum at the same tome to be FORCED to vote about our future???
Are you ever going to quit obsessing over Clinton and the various piddly-arse infractions she is supposed to have comitted? I suppose the clown show in the WH is just too painful to contemplate.
Well young lady you appear way stronger than those lower 48 "snow-flakes", and instead of wasting your time with these fools you should get put on a tribal court to really give it your intellect and strength.
Its often said that he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. However It was placed somewhere else at birth where what little brain that he has resides.
Your jealousy and mediocrity shines like the sun.  You go buddy. Life will work out for you like a gem.
Talk about naïve, that would be you.  You seem to think it is acceptable for two people to have more wealth than 30% of Canadians; talk about sad.  We allow that!!!!  Not them.   And let me guess, you then go on to blame government and overspending.  Fact, people and corporations paid far more in the 30's up to the early 80's.   It is well documented their wealth was nowhere near as obscene as it is today.  An average CEO would make 10-15X the average employee, it is now in the USA about 350x, but to you that is acceptable for these job creators.  I am astonished literally astonished at how naïve your comment is.   The economic system is not real it is a man made construct.  A construct that is more and more manipulated by the very few.  Utterly astonishing people would agree with you and then not have any understanding how it affects them when they watch their wages stagnate and all they can do is attack government workers.  Pathetic.
Perhaps some people on this page should enter politics...  seems fitting since the ignorance and blatant stupidity of comments would certainly guarantee a seat in provincial politics....
Oil wells all over our open space and parks, and a Trump Tower on every corner! Nice job America! You've elected a complete idiot to run the country. You must be proud, Trump voters!
he really thinks we are dumb enough to believe his alternate facts........we are on to you JT
Bill: His last name is spelled Petersen - And you are really obnoxious.
Maybe "Your a stupid idiot" so it is more comprehensible?
Muting a cretin?
dTrump with Moscow Hookers? No wonder that Melania is nowhere to be found or heard from  of late....time to divorce the lying scumbag and take his $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$......if there is any tangible worth after all the LIENS and LAWSUITS launched against him. Good advice! Take it Melania! Soon to be impeached anyway so no great status loss! Oh, and would be wise to get an HIV test too!
Wow, Putin has the lying pig that's President of less than half of the US by the nuts!  Wild conspiracy theories are running through my mind.  A dead Russian hooker in a hotel suite?  A shady international business deal involving arms?  What could it be?  Trumps unwavering defense of a murderous thug is DEPLORABLE and INDEFENSIBLE!  Yet, his supporters continue to defend and make excuses.  At some point you'll have to just face it.  "I told you so.  You damned fools."   HG Wells Author, War of the Worlds
That's the most ridiculous shit I've ever heard. It is not the schools responsibility to raise children. Parents need to know what is going on in their children's lives and control who and where they are. If they would have had decent childhoods and no traumatic experiences with loving caring competent adults in their lives they wouldn't have done this.
Wow, Junior and his band of idiots have only been in power 1 year and already he is pitting different regions of the country against each other.
"STUPIDITY" should be against the Law.................
He's someone who thinks you're a pathetic bigot.
Think of it as 'comic relief'?  Perhaps he is the real 'motley fool;' on this site?  And I am just a pretender?  motley fool - a professional clown employed to entertain a king or nobleman in the Middle Ages.  jester, fool
These neocon right wing religious idiots are at the back of every stupid thing the States does. I despair for the world. Here comes the Rupture, sorry, Rapture.
Vegan schmegan. Tofu's still crap and tastes like it too.
Wrong. Muslim isn't a race so how can it be 'racist'? It is a lawful and appropriate  operating procedure that US CBP does secondary inspection on those born in or families from countries such as Pakistan or Saudi. In addition folks who are argumentative or jerks get the same treatment which is likely the case here.
Every time someone comes across as boorish, ignorant or hateful they're labeled as "Hitler". Do you have any clue whatsoever of how disrespectful and dismissive you are of the 6 MILLION people he murdered when you say that??????
That the benefit would not be worth the cost is clear to any intelligent person, but we’re talking about a State that voted for Trump. Alaska is fast becoming the Appalachia of the north.  Seems Trump voters are eager to return Alaska to full colony status, where we are only good for supplying the rest of the United states - and other countries - with our resources, for which we get little to nothing. Then when Alaska has been sucked dry by outside interests, we’ll be left with the ugly, broken, empty shell.  And who’s helping to do this? Our very own senators, legislators and Mallot, both of whom expect to get rewarded handsomely.   Of course, the very same morons who voted for Trump also voted for the Republicans Gand semi-blue idiots who voted for Mallot.  These Alaskans - if you can them that - have no pride or backbone. They are pigs at the trough of our destruction. For shame.
The players can kneel, as is their right. We, the fans, can criticize the players for kneeling. The players don't like being criticized, so they and the left claim it must be racism, even though white players would also be criticized. So the racial aspect is pure baloney. The players say they are not disrespecting the flag or the anthem, yet their actions SHOW everyone that is exactly what they are doing. If I go out on the field and start burning a flag but say I'm not disresrespecting it, is anyone going to believe me? Nope. Kaepernick said he would not honor the flag of a country that oppresses minorities and he started the whole thing. So this whole "we are not disrespecting the flag" is crap. Do the players really think what they are doing is going to solve all the racial problems of this country? That's just crazy and not what I watch the games for. I am so close to turning the games off and I love me some NFL. This is a loser for the players
Wow. Are you really shooting for stupid comment of the year? No mention of the thieves of course. Probably pals of yours. What a complete idiot.
you nut job liberals only want public sector hacks to be interview it seams, well lib no thanks try refuting the facts they posted if you can ! of course you can not so being empty of such the liberal trolling bs of insult is the norm proving again how pathetic liberal are
Bunch of dropout misfit goofballs..but it makes for entertainment and scenery ain't bad
Gawd, a surfeit of satellite and cable TV is going to be the death of us.  Dumbed down to the level of Ted Nugent.  This is international relations and politics folks.  It's not cage fighting.
the lunatic left haters like you  are unwilling to ever do anything based on laws and facts but make up lies to attack trump daily!,,
Thanks for the info. I offer condolences to the families of those who died, and I pray that the wounded fully recover. I'm not trying to look callous. But, physics still matters. It doesn't matter that the shooter was 320 ft in the air, he still needed enough horizontal velocity to cover half a block to accomplish all that harm. And I'm worried that Al Qaeda and terrorist wanna-bes know how to read English. They've used planes, trucks, knives. This idiot (Civil Comments won't let call the shooter anything worse) just gave a bunch of other idiots new ideas.
Wow. Really? Trump keeps making idiotic statements about him. Is he just supposed to take it?  McCain is a war hero. He was a P.O.W.  Trump does not like war heroes that were captured.  Trump is a draft dodger and a coward.   Are you serious? You are defending the draft dodger? Are you Vietnemese? A draft dodger? A communist?  I can not figure out why anyone would defend Trump’s idiotic attack on McCain.  What is really incomprehensible to me is how anyone would defend a draft dodging coward.  Good luck with that. Why not go down to the VFW and tell every one that you support draft dodgers.
How wrong art thou? Let me count the ways:  (1) Qur'an doesn't order Muslims to kill people on the basis of belief (2) Qur'an says nothing about 72 virgins (3) Dismissing a book you haven't read as 'evil' without reading it--you clearly haven't read it--is stupid.
Remember when you said "when your run is over just admit when its at its end." That goes for you too..your 45, rap is a young man's game and you haven't had a decent album since recovery and that was like 10 years ago..As a former fan it sucks to see you go downhill...but for real nobody wants to watch a middle aged rapper, just looks stupid..your biggest fans like me grew up..you should too
Good to see that you like your own comment. What a loser.
I think you are right. Once the beast operates, we're in for an unpleasant surprise. These legislators are clowns rewarding incompetence from the city. Who does that? We know they did.
Because he was too busy getting things done, rather than heading down to Juneau to politic with the idjits.
no it is God's revenge for hanging chads and putting Shrub - the dumbest president ever - in power
FBI clears Hillary by saying she is to stupid to be president.
You seem like the type who would forget to wipe and then complain and try to blame someone when you have a stream of brown running down your leg.  Take some responsibility for yourself don't blame others for your ignorance.
Simply focus on the fact that ILLEGAL ALIENS, are in fact illegal. Furthermore, remember that the Constitution & its first 10 Amendments - The Bill of Rights - apply only to American citizens - not to other inhabitants of the world. Period.  How the sanctuary city mess ever got started & was allowed to remain is yet another left-brained, liberal travesty.
"They think we are idiots and we are because we continue to allow them to govern."  And at least on that point...they'd be correct.
Your an idiot
Corruption even against their own 'useful idiots'.
The republicans are whores, they will destroy the future to satisfy the greed and avarice of their corporate and exploitive supporters at the expense of anyone else. They are delusional, short sighted selfish dimwits.
THEY Pay? THEY pay for state government? They pay with OUR money from OUR resource, sport. They are the hired hands who bribed corrupt republican legislators and ended up with the keys to the ranch.  By all means, keep cheerleading for them. Try not to get drilling fluid on your pompoms.
That is the standard speech from idiots and snowflakes.
Trump is a piece of sh!t and hopefully he dies on the flight there of a heart attack. The vegas shooting is a perfect demonstration of the blighted hellscape republicans want to linflict on america.  Easy gun access means easy gun deaths, its a simple verifiable fact. Not to mention republican policies preventing a humane healthcare system from being deployed nation wide results in the survivors of that shooting begging for money online so they can afford to not have their lives further ruined.  The republican party is a sickening unamerican conglomerate of traitors, racists, and hateful morons.  and thats without getting started on the literal treason republican F wits enable and endorse.
Re Pete: The Pit Bull lunged at her. Yes, if properly raised and trained then there is very little chance of this happening. It is the nature of a Pit Bull attack that makes them so dangerous. Do we let any one handle dangerous materials without a licence? The owner was a weenie with no control over the dog. With all dogs if you allow other dogs to push your dog around it will take the dominant role and follow its natural instincts. Dogs demand that there be a boss. Please just do to trot out that tired old "no bad dogs, just owners". That is why when Ontario banned Pit Bulls the  ministers only comment was banned, banned, banned. He did not want to get into a stupid debate.
You are an idiot.  This guy has been a nut job, convicted felon long before Trump was elected.   Trump had absolutely nothing to do with this and you know it.
Typical elitist response - you are "ignorant" and you are a 'bigot."
Wow..totally disgusting that this creep got such a lenient sentence. Rapists should be sentenced to life in prison and chemically castrated...and a lobotomy would be a nice idea, too.
No Shiat Shelock through fraud and then purchased the new name of Kinder Morgan you corrupt ass. That's the point of referencing the fraud you lobby for.
Sessions is already walking back his dumb comments on enforcement. I hope he's stupid enough to attack 29 states. Trump will eat that old man.
Are there that many losers in Anchorage?
Has this opened yet? Can't wait for some Cracker Barrel! Gotta support the financial losses while I get me some delicious breakfast. Fuck the haters.
Ooh, sparkleboy, everyone is so afraid of you and the baby-in-chief.  Not sure you or Trump could even kick your own ass.  Nobody takes either of you seriously.  You, like Trump are scared little wimps who talk a big story but run to mommy when there's trouble.  Would love to see whiney little bitch Trump say SOB to an NFL players face.  You and your hero Trump are pathetic little babies.
GARBAGE !  Does the truth hurt?   I'm merely stating the obvious .
That guy is useless.
Jim Crawford you burn on the Governor, yet do not see the log in your own eye. Take a look at the tapes of the SB128 vote. Gleams in the eye all the way around less Charlie Huggins. No reason he wasn't there but no one asked, he ducked it, again. Yet, he's sniffing around for a Governor's run! Ridiculous!!! How about explaining your chief of staff Deb Grundman's absence Senator, get to it. Then Chenault sez: He doesn't have the votes for an override in special session. The monkeys out of the bottle. Alaskans have been had, bamboozled, run amok! I rightly guess legislators, former big guys like Crawford and the rest think everybody is just stupid. Tiring, very tiring.
"B'nai Brith Canada spokesman Daniel Koren said in an interview the posters seek to embolden white supremacists.  "The posters included coded signs and messages to people in underground movements who espouse hatred against Jewish people and others, he said.  "When you're promoting imagery that says to people who understand what it means — Jews will not replace us — and all those connotations, especially given recent neo-Nazi rallies, yes, I would say definitely the work of white supremacists," Koren said."  All grist for Mel's "satire."
Republicans r sick ... wastes of human skin.
Many things wrong here, in no particular order:  The govt shouldnt 'be an agent of change'.  Only idiots think the issue is mail-in vs getting but of couch and into a polling place.  Real issues: One party state, so why should anyone with other inklings bother?  Even Dems, why should they bother when the same names get rehashed - a city council person can pop up agaon as a mayoral candidate then state legislator then federal legislator then back into a state office, then run some commission by appointment,  then back in the race for another office. ... who cares? Where's the new ideas?
will you please stop making a fool of yourself.  Diluted bitumen has the same chemical and physical properties and density and viscosity levels than other types of crude oils.  This oil sands-derived crude oil has been travelling through North American pipelines for decades and is well understood by the industries responsible for producing, transporting and refining it.
The only explanation, short of sheer idiocy, is that those who drink this water are buying into product trendiness.
If someone stole my vehicle, I would expect the police to try to find the thief. When the thief is encountered by police, if he is stupid enough to draw his gun, ........... it was not overkill by the police.
You just did comment on it, you hypocrite. Go ahead, flag me, run from the truth. See how quickly this becomes "uncivil comments" when you show up?
bs loser, the ndp and  fed libs are continuing to kill off alberta , under torys it was a boom
what a joke - why bother with legal immigration then - just pay the Rcmp to be bell hops, get rid of Canadian passports, continue to grow our debt while encouraging unveiled terrorism by simply crossing over the evil nation state called the US of A.  JT's stupidity knows no bounds.
trump, is a liar, and he has something to do with the Russians and I hope all will come out.  I would bet through his taxes will show that trump is corrupt.
Woo! That was a close call!  Now Thornton will continue to be know for walmart shootings and meth dealing. Keep that golf crap out of Thornton! NIMBY!
User profile image Timothy Mcmillan4 minutes ago So is Eric senior still eligible for “Father of the Year” if his son’s dead body was found bloated full of weed, xanax, coke and fentanyl? If so, that would be quite an accomplishment for a man who just lost his job because he’s a deviant sexual predator. Way to go Eric Sr.! Hang in there!
The actual quote is "The fish rots from the head down."  Scaramucci can't even get that right.  Trump has put an idiot in charge of communications.
What I remember most about these floods, is the incredible stupidity on the part of sightseers.  I saw people duck under the "Police Line - Do Not Cross" tape we had strung along Bear Creek in Jeffco, to go down and get a better look at the water.  I even caught one idiot with his two-year old child toddling around the bank next to the rushing water.  I asked several people that I caught on the wrong side of the tape, "You just ducked under tape that says "Police Line - Do Not Cross.  What do you expect me to do with this?  You DO realize that I could arrest you?".  Dumb, sullen looks in response.  Apparently I was the bad guy.
I disagree, Trump doesn't need to accomplish anything to win again, he just needs to keep fighting the corrupt swamp politicians and washington and calling out the lying media. As long as he fights with the parasites he could accomplish nothing and still get re elected. That is how much the globalist parasites are hated.
Tabatha Southey is a crazy borderline personality misandrist that has destroyed her husband's life--beloved comedian Dave Foley from Kids in the Hall. I suggest to anyone reading her articles. and her employer, to read about how she greedily forced Dave Foley to pay money he never had, lying about abuse, and horrendous other details of abuse and psychological and emotional torment using her children for private gain and revenge. She shouldn't be a reporter on anything about values or integrity or facts because she has none of those and is a pathological clinically insane selfish horrible human being.
The archdiocese doesn't seem to want to trust its Catholics to make employment decisions by themselves, seeking, shaming them away from work that doesn't support the Mexican Government's position.   The archdiocese'appears to be in bed with the Mexican government.  They'd rather their subjects simply went on the Mexican (or US) welfare system than work on a big wall project, designed to enforce the laws of a nation.  Mexico is full of illegal activity...drugs, prostitution, you name it...no shaming from the archdiocese.   There's no "shaming" away of Mexican people from such corrupt employment...because if they did shame the Mexicans that support the drug and prostitution trade the archdiocese would immediately feel the he
Yes he has been in office for almost 100 days and what the hell has he done except use tax payer dollars to go on trips to Florida to play golf.  He makes Obama look like a tightwad.   And what exactly do you want to Donald to get done?   Lob more bombs into countries halfway around the world?  Build a stupiod wall?  Transform America into Orwell's Oceania?  This phony is so out of his league it is pathetic.
Perfect example of how dumb Trump is.  3.4 million Americans are suffering and Trump tweets about a nearly forgotten issue. Is that leadership?
Oh great deliverer of wisdom and knowledge! Look up Maunder Minimum You will learn a new thing Oh and then look up Useful Idiot... You won't like that one.
Don comes through again! Hilarious and enticing at the same time. Let Trumpists pay for their damn wall!
LOL, Captain Crayons,, hilarious! Will this moron from the land of unicorns and rainbows ever stop earning uncomplimentary nicknames
Just enough time to sober up and avoid felony DUI and manslaughter. My heart goes out to the family and I hope justice is done.  She might have lived if he wasn't such a pussy.
Maybe because you're Bruce Carson and people told you that you stink?
American women are traitors in Trump's America
Your ignorance knows no bounds.
Your an idiot!!!!
Drip, Drip, Drip, they are all liars...don't believe anything that Kushner, trump jr. and sr.  says.  No action on the Russian Sanctions yet.  They are destroying our country.
Paul Ryan is nothing more than a Koch Brothers lapdog.  Socialized welfare for them, rugged individualism for the rest of us.  No wonder it is closed to the public.
The scumbag meter is in the red this summer.
I'm gonna explain the issue here to you, and the other Liberal paid hacks and sockpuppets here.  The fundraisers are not illegal. No one has said they are. Yes, the CPC and others held them as well. Again, no one is saying anything to the contrary.  The problem here is the Liberals are openly flouting the PM's own guidelines he set out for the conduct of government Ministers.  The other problem is the Liberals are too arrogant to admit it and deal with it.....  ....and paid hacks like you are too blind and stupid to see it.
They're trying to figure out the "why", because he's nuts that's why. Send this turkey back to Turkey, or Los Angeles and duct tape him in his seat before flight takes off.  Problem solved.
my god you live in a delusional world of bs making such nonsense up,, all based on your lunatic left hate of trump ,, get medical help you need it
I just love it when the President provokes the left to completely melt down. On another site a person said that they love Trump now even though in the beginning they did not support him because he is not like all Republicans after Reagan and before Trump who would pee their pants if the press or the Democrats even said boo to them. I agree. Now it is the Dems who are peeing themselves.
Hey old fart, you losers have always been fake news.   You are the enemy of the American People.
Just a suggestion.  We need an 'idiot" button.
Don't forget to take down the stained glass featuring saintly depictions of pedophile priests.
Make him worm.
Right. A racist, sexist, bigoted, adulterous liar of a president should be supported, and those who voted for him praised.  Previous conservative presidents at least gave lip service to their Christianity. Do you really see Trump doing even that?
This is just like the Presidential election where neither Trump or Clinton were qualified. Ice vs. Hanabusa is even worse.  Can't anybody come up with a decent candidate or all the politicians corrupt imbeciles?
So it is just fine with you that some idiots burn down businesses, cars and other vehicles to engineer social change? Doesn't matter that many of those vehicles and businesses are minority owned?
Trump is a walking pile pf garbage.  An awful President and human being.  Worthless in every way.
Digging deep for CONservative pundits?  Starr was, also, just forced to resign from Baylor University fat cat job for his part in the sexual predation and harassment scandals of the coaches and players on the football team.  Starr is nothing more than a Republican attack dog attempting to salvage the residue from the Republican traitorous attempts to overthrow the national governing system and all human rights contained therein.  His Clinton debacle was nothing more than a cash cow for himself and his lawyer buddies in the millions of dollars of taxpayer funds.  His incompetence as President of Baylor University was finally exposed for all to see.  Nothing this clown writes or says has any validity for anyone with brain.  Time for a Revolution.
BLM= "Pigs in a basket Fry them like bacon"  Sorry  I don't associate with terrorist groups from either side of the aisle.
As are most of his republican brethren, Don Young is a charlatan and a knuckle head.
"Might even be true." " Somebody was certainly stupid with his e-mail."   "Might even be true."  "Might even be true."  "Might even be true."  "Might even be true."  "Might even be true."  Were you reading too fast or just understanding too slow?
Nothing compares to the Donald when it comes to lies.  He promised he woud release his tax returns but didn't.  He promised health care that would be so great and so inexpensive but instead pushed some republican crap in the Senate.  He should have pushed medicare for all.    Sweet Hillary is history but she would have made a better president.  At least we wouldn't have Putin as the unofficial FBI director.   The imaginary fears surounding Hillary is still alive I see.  They are nothing compared to the real fears surounding the Donald.  Come on Donald, release your tax returns so that we can see how closely tied you are to Putin.  Coward!
We are told the economy is good so why have a deficit at all? A good economy will balance the budget. Thank you to the 39% of Canadians that vote for these clowns.
If you were dumb enough to believe that garbage, then you deserve the mess.  BTW, hillary voted in favor of it.  And, the middle east issues isn't just a GW problem.  Every president since WWII has been contributing to it.  EVERY president.
"So why are we spending $ billions on bottled water.'  Does the pejorative yet descriptive word 'stupid' cross your mind?
Looks like you finally realized Trump is worthless.  Now you only have to figure out that the Republicans are just as worthless as Trump is.
You are crazy!!!  Did you just drop from some other planet???   You know NOTHING about the Pope!!!   Holy Father Francis will want this abortion clinic closed.
"dope fiend" lol!
You, the politicians of Alaska, are the worst representatives of the people I have ever had the misfortune to see.  You are not stupid people.  You hear the masses tell you "NO" to a new building and you do it anyway.  How do you look people in the eye and tell them you are working for them?  I am ashamed that you are the face of our State.
So dumb. Q: What percent of white men hold executive jobs at their companies? A: A tiny fraction of one percent. Q: What percentage of white men are congressmen? A: A tiny, tiny fraction of a percent.   The white man has become the boogey man, when the job situation for 99.9999% of white men, and their chance of being promoted, is no different than that of women and minorities. Oh, and, given the reverse discrimination, in academics minorities and women are being hired and promoted at a much higher rate than white men, but based on their sex and skin color, and NOT on performance.
You could see the ‘corruption’ pouring out of Hillary’s pores, when Chris Wallace asked her questions on the Clinton Foundation.
Anderson writes:  "Who would think that the CIA and their other partner agencies in the security business have credibility."  --  Who would think that Donald Trump, Putin's lapdog, will last two years before being impeached by his own Republican Congress?
Taking advantage of 13 year old girls. The guy should get 10 years at least. What a disgusting pig of a man. And to think he had the nerve to look and say "Are you happy now" as they led him off. Well no I'm not, you won't spend nearly enough time in jail.
Tomorrow he/all other #FAKERS will come with other "evidences" to continue their lies go... Oh, how disgusting/tiresome/stupid it all became.
Very very true. No can order them from Amazon.com. Not even regular batteries. Funny if you order directly from Wasabi Battery company they will ship to Hawaii. Thank God for them to neutralize Washington stupidity.
Thing is we're better than that. Albertan's actually care about the country, not like that petty tribal nitwit in Montreal.
When - Oh when - will our pundits and scribblers focus on the DEBT instead of deficits. Deficits are a temporary phenomenon and the $$ figures are always conveniently small, whereas it is the accumulated debt that is the scary issue - especially if/when interest rates should ever rise.  It's the DEBT stupid  .-)
Maybe you had a sheltered life. For this we will forgive you. 50% of teachers don’t have any fucks to give. You have a 50% chance of learning because of this. And those shitty teachers are usually worried about creating the bully system that beat them down so now it’s their turn to lay the pain on.   Yes people need to take action for them self but remember many or most have been forced to struggle through the lies and deceit throughout their childhood. It’s actually a fucking miracle we have people living past 50 with the stupid shit people do.
This apology means nothing, seeing how it comes from a proven liar.  Her conduct belittled her colleagues and was dishonest and shameful.  She needs to be removed from cabinet .
I have seen enough to know not to trust any one who professes Allah and adheres to the ideology of hate, pedophilia, degrading and mutilation of woman, beheading of Christians, bombing of innocents, genocide, World conquest which are all tenents of the Islamic faith. Faith in a God who is not filled with mercy and calls for the drinking of camel piss. Allah is not God and Muhammed is just an extremist pedophile baal worshipper of the moon.
More $$$ waste and abuse of the State AG's office..Why do we put up with this???!!!! These clowns need to leave their positions now!!!
I am  not jealous of the wealthy, I am against against  p**** grabbin', lying, oligarchs like the Donald and his lovefest with Putin.  Since when did the Republicans embrace communism?  Since  the Donald, I think.  aloha
Ok, you say Fox news and Breitbat don't tell the truth. So,I went back and watch Trumps press conference. Here were is exact words: The KKK, white supremacist and the Neo nazis are repungnant and violence has no place in this country. Yet, the left and the braindead media, CNN, ABC MSNBC, all lied and said Trump likes the KKK. So, there you go, just caught you and every news media except Fox lying thru your teeth like only scumbags can do.
These protests where not about hate. They were about outrage with a man who brags about sexually abusing women - "grabbing their pussies" without any permission being president. It's disgusting to most of us. Not about hate, about truth of who this animal called president is.
What an enept WH. All useless baggage coming off that plane. Why is an adult son in law and daughter flying with the president? Oh yeah, they're "fake" politicians. Why didnt Barron go with mommy and dad? ExCeo Tillerlesson is another "fake" politician. Now USA CEO teumpf wants to overhall again?  More useless time spent this drama then "America First". With all these natural diasters, trumpf never does a flyover of disaster areas. . Wait he is a disaster. What a "loooser"
Both Podesta and Hillary are evil Satan worshipers.
Justin is todays embarrassment
"Since most Americans are crazy"  Here we see the breathtaking hypocrisy of the Left on full display with all the ugly racism that it claims to oppose.  BTW, the US electoral college just confirmed Trump as POTUS yesterday. Enjoy hiding in your "leftie Safe space" for the next 8 years...
Who's the fools who disagreed with statement? Bet they work for the government. Those poor government fools, aren't they sick of being hated by the general public? Do they really want to be treated as complete out cast? A sec of society  who grossly feed of the backs of people who sacrifice soooooo much more than they do ?  Truly wake up, you don't want this - it can and will get much worse.
Isn't it okay to call him an idiot if the Secretary of State has rightfully identified him as a "moron"?
what's this, repartee for imbeciles? the argot of crass?
Awesome! I should grow up right? So back in the  day when rent was cheap and I was a FT single working mom and heck that was like $775 a month for worst case right!? I don't know if you've been in another dimension for last 12 years but now that same apartment rents for $1300 a month. Unless you present facts via research with a link to those statistics you can kiss my arse you stupid fool!!
And refilling it with millionaire and billionaire scum who got rich off the little man
So the fact that sexist Conservatives have been calling her "Climate Barbie" for years means it's okay?  The story isn't that Rebel Media is now using it, it's that it was used by a member of the House of Commons.  We generally try to hold politicians to higher standards than internet trolls.
He mocks EVERY illness, except one. Then he flips out. He is a hypocrite.
Penalty on the Villages? No, this was the act of one idiot and I hope this idiot will be charged and made an example of. There are many of us living in the region that wanted the bison to succeed, Bison 124 had been out here for a longtime before it was needlessly shot by this one idiot. It was not the act of these 2 villages. Penalize the villages for the act of Mr. Moore? That's like saying people in the cities should be penalized for not educating a murderer.....
Portfolio insurance was PURE profit for CMHC......my home was backend insured for years.....and I only owed about 30% of the value......Trudeau and his backside buddy Morneau are morons.
Hey SA, I think I've seen enough articles on this idiot.  Is it really necessary to keep talking about him?  You must have a lot of dead space to fill up.  How about finding something about Trump to bash?  You seem good at doing that and your readers really eat it up.
Another CONFIRMED Russian troll
your stupid if you think their just "a hostile crowd of sniveling idiots begging for a reason to riot" these stupid ass police officers didn't like that he was homeless and were originally only supposed to be arresting one guy the police officer told jeff that he was not being detained and physically grabbed him after he started to walk away if you think that is right in any way then you are just fucked in the head.
Right, khada is a leech to Canada's good tax paying people. Lawyers are the leeches suckers. JT just gave a violent pious extremist wacko ten million dollars. We are truly F#$%@%
You obviously don't know what you are talking about. If you are a "catholic", you don't know much about your religion. Nobody is playing dress up. And if you aren't Catholic, you should keep your mouth shut and hide your ignorance.
These idiots are all over the island. No matter color or creed, rich or poor. Ban alcohol. One thing, in this State and others,  drunk drivers kill more then drunk shooters.
Not sure this is criminal? I can assure you it is. This is accounting fraud. Fraud is a criminal act. Just look at the resorts the former heads of Worldcom and Enron are currently enjoying. I particularly like the excuse the Criminiberals used here. It is the American standards that allow it. Since when did Canada become America Whynnbag? All I can say is that the people of this once great province had better grow a brain and hand these inept twits a record electoral loss next year. I don't care how stupid a person is or how ignorant of the facts a person is, even a rock could see that this government needs to be exorcised.
Trump is a Nazi idiot! It is called freedom of speech my Mussolini fool! He is brain dead and should be removed from office!
He had a duty to get it right.  Either he deliberately lied or was incompetent.
no skid mark, it's all about how you are incapable of posting anything remotely intelligent. It's all about how you forever run like a coward from the facts that show just what an ignorant fool you are. It's all about your lack of character as a *&^% stain.
The Donald is just full of crap.  I have written my representatives telling them to refuse to consider any changes until the Donald lives up to his promise to release his taxes.  Come on Donald, stop lying and release your tax returns.   His tax reductions for the middle class will be just like providing the best medical care imaginable.  (nonexistent)   Why do people still believe this garbage?
educated adults should just laugh and feel sorry for the pathetic brain washed ignorant sheep like you , you are as close we come to a clown these days!,,
Hmm, but what about Canadians who are not dumbed down Bill ? They seem to have seen your despicable report.
A Tesla commercial indeed  and right beside this one is a Ford F150 commercial but yet I see no sidebar comment from the peanut gallery on that. Just a tad bit hypocritical don't you think Monkey man.
This misandric idiot former PERsecutor had he phangs out because it couldn't help itself in being jealous of anyone who was or is more than she ever was. I'm disappointed that Tiger is having such a tough time as wish I could have the pleasure of watching his play like he used to. Of course, unlike the troll, phang I'm a real sports fan and not a jealous never was hater.
Come on Peggy P.  There are precedents for the President's daughter acting in the capacity of First Lady in terms of both advising the President on matters of State and attending official functions as the President's social partner.  Given the astute nature  of your commentary over time - as much as I might disagree with most of it and consider you to appear terminally naive and thus akin to one of Stalin's "useful idiots" (along with Celeste - ouch!), I have to believe that you are aware of this fact. The snide comments by the resident GM SJW's insinuating either a criminal or a perverse sexual relationship between the President and his daughter are sad and quite frankly surprising given that the level of Lefty commentary in these submissions are generally so highbrow.  Please oh All-knowing Celestial One don't censor me here.  Please my legal feathered friend, pleeeeze.  I'll melt.
Trump is an ill-informed flim-flam man utterly unfit for the presidency.
Posters like sarge22, NP5491, RTH, all do a good job of revealing what the GOP is all about.  Slogans, self-inflicting-wounds tribalism, greed for power (as opposed to a desire to govern a whole people), and a dogmatic romance with foregoing that causes profound ignorance, divisiveness, and exceedingly poor choices and decision making.  McCain's basic plea is for "order".  An orderly decision making process, and orderly construction of consensus, and an orderly consideration of what it means to responsibly govern.  The GOP leadership, and the Yahoos who enable it, instead chant, engage in tribalism, search frantically for ANYTHING (good or bad) that secures or enhances "power", and does it all based on dogmatic edicts from some insane, delusional prounouncements and directives from idiotic maniacs setting the GOP agenda.  Oppose it?  You're out of the tribe.  Counter the chants?  They chant louder.  Challenge the "power", and they counter with action to show they have "more".  Stupid.
Uh? Harper delivered 6 straight deficits including a record $56 billion in 2009-10. He lowered the HST lowered taxes and wiped out in no time flat a huge surplus he inherited from the Liberals. And Harper's deficits were on nothing not even infrastructure which Trudeau's is based on. As usual you CONS are complete idiots and haven't a clue.
SS, there is stupid and then there is stupid. I'm not even sure where  you fit into the two categories. "Fake news" by the Globe and Mail?   Are you nuts? .
A moron at the wheel can defeat any of these technologies. The best defence is to be a good driver.
Pointless comparing those two traitors Baird and McCallum. O Canada!
Talk to your Globe editor if Pamela McColl keeps showing up in comments sections of news items concerning MJ. She sows maligned and an ignorant grasp of facts about MJ, trolling every article with a moral panic, drug-scare mentality divorced from peer-reviewed evidence. Why, Pam? Why do you care so hard?
Trump is just playing to his base. You know the deal.  Black celebrities can and admirably do bring racism to the public focus. Trump is playing to the bigoted idiots that liked his 7 years of "birther" horse excrement. He gets em all fired up over nothing, pretends he is all presidential, tweets his brains out. Next day its some other trivial attention seeking headline. Tired of winning already!
<Hm.. all these links are based on the uniformed opinion of Honore and the Mayor.> Hm ... you either haven't read or you're deliberately misrepresenting the independent reporting from the New York Times, the Washington Post, NBC News, the New York Daily News, among others -- all of whom have their own reporters on the ground in Puerto Rico. Don't bother with the "fake news" drivel; Trump makes a fool of himself every time he says it: why would you join him? Describing the observations of Gen. Honore and Mayor Cruz as "uninformed" is preposterous, dishonest.  Interesting that you cite Russia in your attempt to whitewash Trump's failure in Puerto Rico: as the investigation into the Russian interference in the 2016 election unfolds, nothing good is happening for Trump or for his surrogates. Trump has clearly, blatantly obstructed justice -- and that's true whether or not there was an underlying crime. Lock him up.  Lock the incompetent, corrupt, filthy, racist criminal up.
They're not idiots for turning right on red, they are for turning right on red when there is oncoming traffic - which is a violation of the right on red law. You can turn IF it's safe, IF you can see and IF there is no traffic coming that would have to avoid you.
Gaga is just another very stupid, anti-American liberal.
I had met the woman when she first started, and have seen her a couple of times since. SHE HAS CHANGED. I to voted for her in the beginning, will NOT do it again. I didn't think she was going to be be the typical moronic Democrat. It seems I was wrong, she is becoming like the rest.
You are an angry and hateful person. I feel sorry for you, and hope some day you find happiness.
These scientists know nothing. They still can't fix stupid no matter how many books they throw at stupid! LOL
Wow, the STUPID is strong in this one...
If you pulled your head out if the sand you'd already be seeing the signs of destruction. Trump encouraging Russia involvement/meddling in our election, Trump putting cronies or people unqualified in cabinet positions, Trump not putting his business interests aside to avoid conflict of interest, Trump making his kids part of the presidency (fascist in the making through nepotism), Trump idiotically Tweeting like a petulant child.   It's all there. But you're blinded by partisanship.
Predator/sociopath much?
All of your hateful rubbish is opinion. Stating that is fact does not make it so.
The usual lying racist comment revising history to their own bigotted ends.  The last 20-30 years of constant attempts at history revisionism so loved by all convservative/fascist/racist media.
Loser.
Correcting a mistake with a mistake in hopes people will get tired of this pissing contest and create an entirely new healthcare/health insurance system. A system that means the needs and wants of the people and not that needs and wants of a bunch of corrupt, arrogant elitists
Trump is a Machiavellian type, which means that there is probably some dark purpose behind even his dumbest moves. This so called clown did defeat the best strategy the Dems had to offer, and they're pretty tricky their own selves. He also conned almost half of America to vote for him. Is it possible that Trump isn't as stupid as his opponents would want to believe?  Trump's latest actions could possibly lure Russia's interests to the west; so that in case of a war between America and China, Russia will be too far out of position, and preoccupied enough, so that Russia won't side with China?  Listen to the bulk of rhetoric ... almost all directed at N. Korea being an existential threat to America.  Our government is clearing the field for battle, and their first move is to pull Russia away from China.  We have the capability to pull a "First-Strike" against China, but not Russia and China simultaneously. Plus, without Russia's backing, China will probably wuss out.
More sentimental, taxpayer-tapping nonsense from Trudeau.
Good defense strategy: "We wuz too dumb to do anyting bad."
How is saying that a liberal bias is overwhelmingly obvious a "personal" attack.  That is a dumb statement.  Like when politicians call it a 'personal attack' for pointing out their voting record and statements.  No, a personal attack would be "Hillary has a fat ass" or "Trump has orange skin".  Saying Civil Beat is a liberal advocacy blog run by partisan liberals is NOT a personal attack.
Huh, whaddaya know. The Sequim Libelous Liar printing an article on how to spot liars. Hmm, I of course suspect it's a trap. They're trying to not look so obviously owned by Soros' boys. Try on, rats, try on.
Disgusting.
These stories and Crimes are committed  almost weekly now.   SEX, PROSTITUTION,  DRUGS, Donahue also pleaded guilty to a charge of felony promoting prostitution in 2012.    In March 2016, she was arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicants after police say she admitted to smoking “four bowls” of marijuana.   Isn't  she  just a little SEX Kitten?????????  As always its the children who are the VICTIMS.  I feel extremely SORRY for them.    Lock this Trash up for a few years.............
I wonder if Derrick Watson realizes what a fool his name has become nationally?  To make a 44 page judgement in 2 hours is bad enough, but his reasoning of basing the injunction on what candidate Trump has said in the past, is absurd, and the country is in disbelief that a judge could overstep his authority to this level.  The corruption in the Democrat party really knows no boundaries, and  is constantly pushing the envelope further and further to the left.  Sad and such an embarrassment to Hawaii.  Of course, Chin isn't from Hawaii, so if things get bad here, hey just go back to Seattle and all will be fine.
"I am a Wall Street guy", so says this foul mouthed thug. He may or may not be but he is certainly a fool.
The media is getting more foolish by the minute. The people elected a leader, judge the person by their actions. Trudeau may be a little more agreeable and photogenic but he is definitely not a leader.
The new jersey is butt ugly but Bautista is the face of the franchise. Anybody who whines about his bat flip, his perceived ego or supposed contract demands is an idiot, because he's done everything they signed him for, and more. Rogers has treated him like an afterthought (he should have a 2 year deal at least) but he's built a family, a fan base and an empire here in Toronto.
The loony left always has a reason for being intolerant.  It's coming people, and soon.
Here's my there-there.  The press and the mean spirited and sore loser Democrats should be utterly ashamed of themselves.  President Trump has been vindicated from the witch hunt which the press and the Democrats galvanized into being.  This stigmatizing of a lawfully elected president is a stench in the nose of more Americans than you can imagine.  It has torn at the fabric of our nation and derailed the necessary business of our country.  If the Democrats had any original ideas they would have brought them forth years ago to alleviate the hemorrhage of American jobs and the assault on small businesses.  Instead, we were treated to leftist ideology all in the name of globalism.  This party should put up or shut up.  As I said, so many people are sick to death of these resentful losers.
Just accept the fact Any time a bureaucrat says they have had positive feedback for one of their brain storms They are lieing Only a fool would believe anything coming from Eugene bureaucrats If Madame kitty said the sky is blue you need to check
Junior is a Chinese Pug.
When I read the title I was hoping to read an intelligent op-ed, instead I find profound stupidity that is doing what the author accuses the GOP of doing. Reagan was re-elected in a historic humiliating landslide, and polls to this day as the greatest President post WW2. Today's GOP wouldn't grasp Reaganomics 101 if it bit them in the bum, and why they have degenerated into political clowns proving liberals do not have a monopoly on stupidity.
' Incompetent idiocy.  Donald Trump is nothing more than a belligerent childish buffoon.  (and a con man.) . .  Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda (web version) — Indivisible Guide   https://www.indivisibleguide.com/web
Trump has been nasty and deflective in his attacks also, or did you miss that?
this shit head is going to get america NUKED!
Wow, what a bitch. Someone invites you to enjoy a weekend with them in a beautiful place...for free, apparently. And you act out your inferiority complex by refusing to join in activities with other guests, complaining about the accommodation, and making offensive assumptions about your friends, their guests, and their parents. Hopefully your pals will wise up and realize that you're so much happier in the city and leave you there the next time they go to their home away from home. Oh and by the way, did they INVITE your dogs?
I concur, their comments above prove they are scum of the earth.
Fake plastic woman who knows what else is fake.  She is the epitome of what is wrong with the culture of the fake crude American woman.
m: You already have them. Re-read my comments and citings if you have forgotten you lazy troll.
You're about as dumb as they come.
Trump is a bold-faced liar and a pure-bred racist. He is no better than a bonafide member of the Ku Klux Klan. He is probably a full-fledged mebmer of the White Nationalists. Trump is a disgrace and an enemy of America. He needs to be impeached.
I don't care what gender, race, or class you are.  I don't care if the person you murder is of the same gender, race or class as you are.  If you shove an arrow through a living man's ear into his brain (Eugene case) you deserve to die.  In that case, the black defendant got to live by testifying against the white bad guy, even though the black guy was the one who actually shoved the arrow into the victim's brain.    And all just to steal the victim's car so all three of them could commit more bank robberies.    And the black guy had gotten off on a previous murder charge in another State by testifying against the bad guy in that case, too.
Yeah, you're right, we shouldn't revere those coding idiots like Sergei Brin and Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg. What losers. Total bottom rung nerds.
Yes, we all have freedom of speech and freedom to protest.  I have no idea what these guys are protesting and I don't believe they do either.  Disrespecting the flag and for which it stands is an idiotic way to protest.  I can't stand to watch this nonsense and the solution is simple.  I ain't watching them anymore.
Comey was a "nut job" in the same sense that if you were hunting for bigfoot or the lock ness monster and you couldn't  find any real evidence anywhere you demand more money so you can continue the search for longer.  Unethical, unfair and ridiculous.
They submarined a good campaign with traction and a worthy cause. Not we are looking at a $16 billion project and a paltry fine. Stupid political system.
you are ignorant of reality, increasing prices means we all have less to buy with bud, and it wont be a fraction increase either when stores etc are costed sometimes to 70% of all costs being labour..
Same troll, different account.
you are pathetic individual with your head between your legs.
So many dumbos here want profound status quo.  Go Hillary! Go Bernie the Commie! You should have voted for them.  Now all you can do is cry.  Try something more productive.  It will be good for you and maybe the country as well.
And Trump Twitters: What a buffoon.
I'm so glad you brought that up. (insults) Pervert, Criminal. Thief, Liar, Pedophile, Misogynist, Islamaphobic, Hater, Oligarch....  Do any of these insults ring a bell with you?  Those are the words used by Trump Haters and left wingers. Thats rude, uncivil ,and wrong. Further, I remember you started the name calling with me.  I know your side will always stoop to name calling when rational thought beleaguers you.  Once you started, I dropped the Dejanitor bomb on you. Waaaaaa  So if you don't like playing in the mud don't piss  on yourself if some one else kicks up a little dust.
I'm amazed at the ignorant and uninformed replies I see on the first 100 days. But that is to be expected form people that spend maybe 15 minutes a day listening to the news from the left wing socialist news sources. You folks really do need to go beyond CNN, Hollywood, and SNL for the real news, but heck, most of you can't figure out which bathroom to use, so your child like and uninformed comments don't surprise me. Educate yourselves folks. Your future depends on it
Like I said earlier, heaven and earth would have moved before I accepted any of this! I would be at that hospital demanding Help even at the risk of being arrested.  Wake up the damn doctor he can sleep after helping a dying patient be comfortable.
What a silly comment, I like Grays, have a few Grays a Bucks to spend.
Everybody is offended today.  OK, little Johnny, let me check the list first before you get dressed for Halloween.  This is ridiculous.
Really?  Dubya?  Have a gander at this link and tell me again how high is IQ is.  They even coined a word for his malapropisms, Bushisms.  http://www.snopes.com/politics/bush/piehigher.asp  Nobody with above average intelligence could be that bad at expressing himself in his mother tongue.  The Donald is probably fairly bright, although he has disturbing narcissistic traits and is a petulant bully.
Have you people finally woken up and realized multiculturalism doesn't work? This has nothing to do with being racist, it is about having a safe and secure country. Go back 50 years before that idiot Pearson and his henchman Pierre Trudeau started this nonsense with other western leaders like Ted Kennedy. Perhaps if everyone had stayed put we wouldn't have this mess.
People who do not have proper arguments always ALWAYS try to name opponents names : trolls, Russian trolls...raymond7A7, are one of them?  And, you should read this.  http://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/defence-watch/chrystia-freelands-granddad-was-indeed-a-nazi-collaborator-so-much-for-russian-disinformation  Or this source is also too Russian for you?  Also, you should not try to whitewash Nazi collaborationist and OUN/UPA supporters. For adults who know the history it  looks childish and ridiculous.   But I understand where the wind blows from. Judging by your nick name, you are the Lett or the Lithuanian... yea,yea, we know about their "fighters for the freedom".
Pausing what was an extremely idiotic decision in an attempt to buy a Security Council seat and is now laying it on Trump?  How about admitting this scabby insignificant seat you want isn't worth the lives of our soldiers simply so you can pump out your chest, Zoolander? This government is nothing but a revolving door of contradictions and double-speak with absolutely no idea how to properly govern.
A day later, and the new system isn't doing well. Russian trolls got a number of first-page posts that were universally disagreed with.
Ha ha! You should work as a journalist for the RE section.  1. CMHC just said it was not supply and demand. "We continue to see strong evidence of problematic conditions in Toronto’s housing market. Economic fundamentals like income and population growth cannot fully explain the rapid growth in house prices in Toronto. (Dana Senagama, Principal Market Analyst , Toronto)  2. Prices have not stabilized as you say, down -17% in Toronto in last 11 weeks. Some GTA towns are down 20 to 30%! That is called a correction and crash for some.  3. The new regulations will drastically impact house sales. It already has! Once OSFI  forces a 2% stress test on uninsured mortgages (80% of total), it will turn heads, Rising interest rates will also slow this down considerably.   At least do some research before posting ridiculous comments!
Ungrateful bunch aren't they. Sort of reminiscent of Okinawa or the Philippines grumbling about our military presence.  Guam should hold an island wide referendum and go with whatever the electorate wants. I'm all for independence for any territory that isn't happy with the US. Seems to me they have most of the benefits of being American and none of the bad things such as taxes. Voting matters little since they have so few people, they would less influence than Hawaii with it's 2 electoral votes. Stupid people often don't realize what they've got until it's gone. They should go ask the Filipinos if they miss Subic naval or Clark air Force Base.
Can we just not use his name?  Just call him "latest scumbag."
I guess this proves Carl had a political agenda when going after Nixon. Unfortunately for Carl, he's now considered a buffoon.
Once again it is political correct to say WHITE people are out of touch with BLACK people, but if I say I am a RED skin Chickasaw who disagrees, I am shouted down as a racist by political correct morons.
Do you dispute this country isn't run by California, New York City, or Seattle?  Trump won 32 states. Almost double what your beloved crooked Pillary win.  Take your sore loser self and go get a Starbucks.
You sound like a loser.
Save your outrage for a topic where it actually makes sense. There is nothing that conservation will do to arrest this "problem." Nothing.    There's a spillway. It gets used. We have a power plant drawing water atten times the rate we are using the water for other purposes.   We call that excess capacity.  Give some thought to where you are pointing that thing. Especially when you are lambasting others' ignorance.
I believe if you read your terms of use here you'll find you just broke that contract and should be banned for suggesting a stranger is in some way mentally unfit.  You're disgusting and without shame for suggesting as much.  You think you're amusing?  As a child did you call other kids retarded?  Aren't you the precious one.
Alice; YOU were the ONLY ONE IN CHARGE!! You had the FINAL SAY on every story, on every line, and on every photo! You took a BUSINESS that was seeing already declining marketability, then you sought to  "change Alaskan's point of view" Instead you simply destroyed ADN's declining readership in typical "charge ahead, we'll force them to see things OUR WAY" "Liberal Elites" fashion...   AFTER THE 2016 ELECTION you & your staff simply went completely NUTS, choosing to slam incoming President Elect Trump with every lie and rumor DEMOCRATS could possibly muster... doing so before the very ALASKAN'S WHO VOTED OVER OVERWHELMINGLY FOR OUR PRESIDENT!!   And there is your constant DRUM BEAT of GLOBALIST POLICY & CLIMATE CHANGE!! Choosing to admonish ALASKAN'S who suffer like no others under OBAMA'S POLICIES just by their NEED to simply WORK TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES!! Shame on US for wanting HIGH PAYING JOBS extracting ALASKA'S RESOURCES!!  I just gota ask, "How STUPID can you possibly be?"
So Trump is meeting with Britain and Israel before he even makes an appointment with Canada.  He knows what a stupid dick we have in charge.
He talks about the stupidity and evil of others but doesn't talk about the stupidity and evil of himself and his wife. Idiots who went into a war zone and exposed their children to horror and death. It is regrettable that these two have reproduced. At the very least Childrens Aid should take away their children. They are unfit to be parents.
The democrats are not at issue.  What is at issue is that we have a president who has lied, far more than any prior president in history.  I do not accept his lies nor do I accept his corruption.  Come on Donald, release your tax returns which you promised.  Afraid of people finding out how tied you are to mother Russia?  What a coward.  Just remember that republicans didn't always stick with Nixon.
A a  his true colors are shining thru. Absolute corruption got his  feeble little mind. This group of republicans are all real easy and sleazy.  Except a few.  They just wore little pin lapels and expensive suits to hide the puppet strings...
Not necessarily. They have endorsed a bigot, a sexist, a racist (you omitted misogynist,  sexual abuser, serial liar, and vulgar bully. Much less han one half, but...over 50% didn't.
Yep. Alaska Native people are definitely the "First Conservationists" and the "true stewards of the land".  Perfect illustration of their stewardship. Just like Johnny Hawk (also a native leader from Eek) killing 9 critically endangered Aleutian Cackling Geese back in the 90s. If it moves, kill it. Sick, pathetic culture.
Why should he have to take the supposed high road?  Trump started this with his nonsense and abrasive nature:  "...“He’s not a war hero,” said Trump. “He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.”..."  Who the heck is Trump to talk?  I can't defend a draft dodger....no matter the war.  I joined and honorably served even though I knew the wars we've had since WWII are largely unjust.  But, I served just the same as a way of thanking this country for the Constitution and the freedoms it gives us.  All Trump did was avoid serving with all of his effort.  Friggin' coward!
The "Russia,Russia.Russia" fiasco is getting really "old, old, old". The Demoncrats and the MSM have found NOTHING, because no crime has been committed. Even Jr's indiscretion is not a crime. I am sick of hearing the inane, moronic comments from the idiots and losers in the MSM. It is time to move on and support PRESIDENT TRUMP's agenda. In spite of the jackals in the MSM, the Dims, and the RINOs, he has made great progress in meeting his campaign promises.  The Demoncrats will get their fair reward when the Republicans gain another 20 Congressional seats in 2018.  PRESIDENT TRUMP - MAGA - Today & 202!!
Thank you for writing this, and for all of you who still don't believe what a jerk he is, just go to Hawaii Free Press and it will tell you all the trouble he has been in since his college days.  This guy is a menace and should have been taken out of office long ago, we don't want people like him controlling South Maui.  Go read for yourself!!!!!!!!!
Complete idiot? Maybe! But he sure aint doing anything for the State he represents!
Your comment of Obama and turd in the same sentence says it all about the last eight years. A few more weeks and you can flush twice and close the toilet lid on the last pathetic decade!
To Alberta moron?
Describing "the most dangerous place on Earth" as a polling booth is saying that if you vote a certain way, great harm will follow. Using that kind of logic, the most dangerous place on earth would be somewhere that current behavior is sure to cause future disaster. The $19 trillion national debt comes to mind. Or the lockup of mining and manufacturing by the EPA. Or the moral collapse of the family. Or the stupidity of the American public school system.
tRump is more whiny than a baby with a wet diaper.
I smell a potential divorce. So sad she married a perp.
Carl Bernstein is calling on journalists to commit treason.  The Left have committed atrocities against the duly elected POTUS, the U.S. Constitution and the American people.  CARL BERNSTEIN IS A TRAITOR AND ENEMY OF THE U.S.
I thought that Bannon was scary but it turns out he is a moron.  The bishops should send him a fruit basket for making them look good.  It is the first time in ages that they have gotten good publicity from the press and lots of kudos from the public.
It's interesting that the RG doesn't see the connection between this and the alt left mob protests in Eugene. These McCarthyist fueled "movement" is, at its heart, a neo Nazi movement and anti-semitism is a part of that. You cannot both accept these terrorists and condemn anti-semitism at the same time. These are NOT liberals. They are intolerant radical thugs.
Ugh. Palin. Why won't she just go away? I nearly forgot about this angry little incompetent troll, except that every time we have an act of terrorism, she tends to come up because of those "survey markers" of hers prior to Giffords getting shot.   All I can say is: thanks, McCain, for inserting this moron onto the international stage.
Time to reinstate the draft ! Everyone needs to serve the country in some capacity ...have a stake in the game instead of just being parasites
The Second Amendment doesn't mention guns, firearms, or any other weapon specifically. It mentions arms, and qualifies the right to keep and use them to only a "well regulated militia". Currently the Supreme Court has ruled that means that municipalities don't have the right to ban use of firearms by citizens, a right that was taken for granted for a hundred years. A future Supreme Court could overturn al prior interpretations, just as the Roberts court did. Any right can be qualified, as the First Amendment has been. The majority of US citizens would go along with strict limits on possession and use of firearms. At some point this will have to happen. The NRA is really screwing up by opposing all restrictions. The NRA should be working toward sensible regulation that would reduce gun deaths and save honest competent gun owners from outright confiscation. The "cold, dead hand" death fantasy is truly stupid.
You don't know that, you were not there.  What we know is that there is NO EVIDENCE whatsoever.  Your Alynskite response says more about you than him.  Instead of calling him names why don't you stop being such a hypocrite.  Your words:  racist, dishonest, disgrace, etc.  That defines you, not him.  Sessions came off the winner here, and people that tried to call him names like this just look foolish.  The dems are foolish.  Everyone is laughing at them after Sessions put them in their place.
"Trump tweeted later: “The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you!”".  The President called him. He did not make the call.  What do you hypocrites want? For him to hang up the phone? Grow up.
trumplethinskin has continuously fed his own dumpster fire, not comedians. His brand is antagonism, This is gonna seem like small potatoes, after he destroys this economy and country, be it with his hugely damaging policies of health insurance death panels or cozying up to a dictator that orders murders on his own citizens. tRump is the problem that congressional cons are still not willing to accept. He is toxic.
This is getting ridiculous. Governor Walker must not be getting my memos. Save the tax debate for next year. Restructure the PF, balance the budget and call er good for the session.
Trump kicks ass! Christine Flowers is just another misguided blowhard who thinks she knows what's best for the country.  A liberal socialist leftwing whack job who simply refuses to admit that Obama was the one who signed this legislation into law while Trump is the one who enforces it. She doesn't tell  you that does she. There are many things she doesn't say because she if full of half truths and cannot be believed. She is a master at propaganda and lies as well as a voice for the left at all costs including her soul.
Your fascist hero was a complete embarrassment on this trip! Shoving someone, stumbling around like a moron, making ridiculous statements about the Germans. This fool has ruined our reputation and turned our own allies against us.
They can't win for losing!  Adam Schiff get your head out of the sand. Feeling very sorry for the lefts stupidity.
Er, no, the Koch brothers paid Alaskans to vote for an out-of-state Koch shill and typically, a bunch of right-wingers bought it hook, line, and sinker. I'm still shaking my head over the stupidity of those voters. It's truly unbelievable and shows they didn't care at all about Alaska, just some blind adherence to a party that uses them as pawns while they lap it right up.
Tell that to the special needs victim who was held hostage and tortured by your side because they thought he was a Trump supporter.  .  Yeah. It looks good on you. Absoltely disgusting.
Salt Lake City's finest. Just another typical thug with a badge. He'll keep his job.
Dumbest comment of the month.
half this country heard the warning about the really bad brown acid going around and decided to forgo food and live on the brown acid instead, now with Trump's success in conning the gullible, vulnerable, angry, and confused, we see the end results of that mass stupidity as we all stumble down the path of no return.  many of us had a 50+ year run of incredible fun despite the hurricane of increasing insanity swirling around us post WW2 when this country paid in buckets of blood to stop those who behaved like Trump, and now we've come to the end of the bumpy ride as we sail off the edge of an easily avoidable cliff into an unknown abyss...
Halfway? This little inbred moron has been a boil on the butt of humanity with his constant threats to his close neighbors and kidnapping foriegn idiot visitors for more money for 5 yrs. Why does China allow this? To keep causing provacation?To keep west paying billions to babysit an idiot? China needs to either mash that pimpel or remove him for good and let N. Koreans pick a leader who will help all its people not just those old buffoons in lock step for aid and perk payouts while most are starving. The West dont want that lousy place, China knows that.  No more money or aid. Maybe NK people will rise up and take him out. He will kill them anyway with his warlord mentality.
Another glaring example of elected officials preferring backroom, secret interrogations to the public's right to know.  Will there be a written record of the meeting?  These individual meetings violate the entire process and, like others say, are a total waste of the nominee's time.  He should refuse to participate in any such political ploys by the cowards currently occupying and violating their seats and oaths of office.  Disgusting.
Nah, butinski.  Doing things like calling these men "Hottentot chimps of the African league in Uganda" is what does that.  For everyone else, see what Trump does?  He emboldens and encourages virulent racists like butinski to say this kind of stuff.  Was this Trump's intent?  Possibly.  It's consistent with his other race baiting statements.    Or, was it something he did not realize would lead to this?  Possibly also, because Trump is an idiot.
The man is a total idiot and a buffoon.  I can't believe he doesn't look in the mirror and start laughing.  Of course, he has no sense of humor so he probably doesn't ever laugh.
Putz, I am well aware that this is a federal program and Alaska's role in it was aided by our Washington delegation. State taxes could be paid, but you might have to pay taxes as well. Your contempt for our youth is matched by their contempt for older parasites like you.Keep writing for the uninformed who read and believe your drivel.
"Jeeze, we have religidiots blowing up bombs in public places, we better work on our tolerance" said no one ever.  What kind of idiocy is the main stream media taking us to?
"I prefer my heros not captured" - right out of the mouth of Trump, and just as disgusting.
' if by successful business people you mean traitors and con men.
How about you kiss my ass? I stand by my earlier comment.
This guy is an anal low life, the boys in prison will take care of him. He'll be a prisoners little bitch and sodimized the first night he's there. Passed around to all for fun gang banging his butt.
Trump is a shape changer to any form and has proven it repeatedly. Serial liar, xenophobic racist, misogynistic bully, fraudulent "businessman", of which 40% of the country find repulsive. Wouldn't you love to do his taxes? You could cherry pick too!
Junior's popularity is dropping like a rock and there is no doubt, especially with the hefty carbon taxes everyone will soon be paying he will be a one term wonder.   Question: Will the Liberals get him to resign to salvage the party like McGuinty did? Personally I think Butts and Telford are too stupid and will take the ship down.
Hawaii lawmakers suck.
"Nothing to look at here folks. Move along, I am a politician and should not have to be bothered by these silly laws that we impose on you peons"
The American voter elected Obama - they are pretty stupid.  Trump likes the poorly educated so he should do well!
"Why do we have to have ignoramuses running the US government? (starting, of course, with the head ignoramus, D.J. Trump)"  Because arguably half or more of the US population is uneducated compared to the rest of  western civilization. Also there is a huge faction (such as in   Florida) who as they get older and richer, become more corporately selfish and uncaring.  Just like Trump.
He makes no sense. He sucks and can't play the position. Don't know how that makes sense to you. Sloter is a better QB.
Who gains out of this ridiculous idea, mapk96?
The President is a violent psychotic who understands absolutely nothing about free speech.  He is mercilessly inept and incompetent, which is why his administration is a complete failure.    Worst President Ever.  No one even comes close.
Now its time for liberal trolls to start tearing down a decent man.
Coming from an imp of perversity with your name Rochdale, which used to be a drug infested hellhole on Bloor Street, Toronto.
AM is an idiotic jock who doesn't know about the issues.
You guys are hilarious!  You demand a say in how the country is run and when it is offered to you, you call the Prime Minister names.     I guess that is your opinion of how the country should be run.    Pathetic
You do realize legislators still work outside the 90-day session right? Good one CORams, making a fool out of yourself.
Republicans are such hypocrites.  Come on republicans be honest for a change. Demand that the Donald release his tax returns. Then give him a 20% increase rather than the lowest bracket.     No one wants to pay taxes but notice republicans are saying nothing about cutting the military industrial complex.  What a waste.
As an indigenous Mandan, I would deport trump as he never displayed his documents.  He is a horrible president.  Let this good immigrant stay.  Throw the sleazy Trump out of the country.
What a loser, looks like a druggie.
Voting for or against someone because of their gender is a fools vote.
Asterixm without a doubt you have posted the most stupidest response of 2016. Congratulations.
You are a crazed optimist. Go to any provincial courthouse in the country on criminal arraignment days. Look at the case list. Probably three-quarters of the cases on the list could be summarily described as "got drunk, did something stupid". Alcohol contributes to most of the crime in this country.  Also, between smuggled untaxed cigarettes and burglaries with the object of stealing cigarettes, there's quite a lot of tobacco related crime.
Wow, what an absolute pathetic country we live in. We are a resourced based economy which should have very little unemployment and no government debt if we didn't have such dim witted politicians and voters wanting us to be something we are not. Between delayed and cancelled energy projects, LNG, pipelines, Ring of Fire to name a couple. Could have been a pioneer for LNG but now the US and Australia own that market. Develop nothing, become more unproductive tax the hell out of the citizens at every turn. We are closer by the day to becoming a socialist society the liberals so desire us to be. I'm terrified for my kids futures.
99% of  all terrorist are Muslim.  But the other Muslims dont want to face that very clear and simple truth.   There is tacit acceptance and even veiled approval in their refusal  to admit it.  Allah Akbar and Inshallah are all important.
You are still saying that two deaths are better than one. Which is "pro-death", not "pro-life".   You claim I am not a proper Catholic, which shows your innate arrogance.
Ted is toast. He needs to go back to Canada. As I have said before, "Cruz is a whining, sniveling crybaby."
I guess the little shit Bernstein is perfectly comfortable with fake news.   Clearly, he hates the idea that a president is going to call out the Democrat Party media when they lie
Trump: Open mouth, insert big, incredibly stupid, traitorous foot.  And what about that long call Putrumpski had with Putin the other day? You know, the only call with a head of state that Trump called that was not recorded?  That's not suspicious at all.
“It's not about the joy of hunting. It's about the love of shooting someone. What else are guns for?”  You are so wildly out of touch with reality. My guns are for hunting, protection while I hunt or fish and target shooting. They are not for shooting someone.   The love of shooting someone?  Are you insane? This kind of garbage is not going to make your dubious opinions seem worth reading, much less considering.
no of course not.  Not the same. You tried to hide stuff from the public record.  Oh wait, so did she.  Another pious hypocrite.
I have no respect for the sodomy-loving pedophile priest club.
Oh baloney. You think those are union men, and that Trump would have paraded out union men? Do you have proof they are descendants, or that they even know about the mine strikes? Those men think their jobs are coming back because that's what Trump literally told them and all America.  Hillary didn't take away the coal jobs, nor did Obama. What took those jobs away was the far cheaper and cleaner, abundant natural gas from fracked wells in the USA. And right now, China is switching to solar and wind. eating our lunch in the Pacific Rim after Trump ditched the TPP. Talk about dumb and dumber.  I know about union strikes and corporate murder of strikers. I've even posted here about some of that. And I don't need any coal miners among my ancestors to know about that.
I don't think she's genuinely racist either, but damn, the woman only opens her mouth wide enough to change feet. As Greg says in the article, she is now a liability to the DA...
His food is fucking gross
Stupid and shortsighted
Well, for starters I wouldn't be a complete idiot getting involved in an American election and taking brainless jabs at the bear and his supporters like a certain PM who thought the Piranha in the Pantsuit was a shoe-in for POTUS and ran his mouth off without thinking like he usually does.  Deservedly, Trump isn't going to do Zoolander any favors for his trashing during the election.  Zoolander only helped escalate our problem with his moronic jabs.  Bu there is the realization there is absolutely nobody with any skills with this gang that can't shoot straight so I guess bawling is the best we can offer until we turf these clowns and get a real government.
And they can be taken to task for it as Republican President Ford was when he pardoned Nixon.  Of course at that time voters were more ethical, moral and sane, recognized corruption, and so vote lost his re-election bid. Now we have Trump's base, a constituency that doesn't know what those words mean and could care less that Trump is at best a corrupt loser and at worse a traitor.
Tax tax tax tax tax tax, tax Seattle residents to death to pay for your stupid Socialist programs and agendas. There are so many homeless because no one can afford to live here anymore, except the very wealthy, and the beneficiaries of the socialist programs that the middle class pays for.  Soon, there won't be a middle class any more in my home town. People are moving away, to more affordable towns with less taxation, while the leftists continue to complain about the wealth divide that THEY are creating.  It's not like we get to vote on these taxes, oh no, just BEND OVER people, cause Seattle is giving it to you whether you want it or not.
Hopefully, whoever was running this "ed-venture" chastised the idiot for harassing the goat.  Another example of human stupidity in the face of pure grace and beauty.
Well, I'm not sure what you mean, but there's a cattle dog by your name so I'll give you the benefit of doubt. Re Wheeler: dying by a lunatic is a piss-poor  "example" for the rest of us.  Killing or disabling an attacking lunatic is a much better one. Be careful about "cowardly"
Take a dimwit dem over a racist republican any day
lol That place is such a dirty place.  They have less than a third of what they offered in the 90's.  Shame.  My gosh that much have been startling to find out about him.  Mr. Bennett must of felt foolish, lol.  I hope he calls all of those long time employees that left due to this liar and offer them their jobs back w/a nice raise.    l2g
If the moderator asked tRump follow-up questions it was because tRump kept trying to swallow the mic by cutting Hillary off.  The longer tRump babbled, the moderator had every right to confront him about his mindless babble.  tRump got a good pxxxy whipping from Hillary, and she didn't have to go into his bedroom to do it.  LOL
What a joke. This guy is an idiot. How on earth does it make sense to punish those that have jobs just so you can keep supporting the entitlement community? MORE CUTS!!!! No more money to areas that can not support themselves. People all over this country move to where the jobs are.  That's how its done.
Too want the President of the United Sates to fail is like shooting yourself in the foot. You are both a fool and a hypocrite.  If you don't like the choice of the American worked ha I suggest you move out of the country. We the American  workers want a viable and working economy unlike the last 8 years under Obama.
A real psycho. Lethal injection is quite appropriate for her.
you sir are a traitor and a fool.  "Death to America" isn't a joke,  they mean it as people and a country.  They are practicing Taqqiyya.  And if you don't know that means, then you are truly ignorant about Islam.
Guns save lives - Drugs take them. You are incorrect in thinking I will not respond because I "see what you are doing", it is because your arguments are so silly I find them ridiculous.
I do not even think the PM knew what he was apologizing for, never mind Canadians.  It is pathetic when his apologies have to be interpreted.  It gives the impression he is lying.  There is no misinterpretation of his lack of sincerity.
You wrote this:  <<And I notice you mention the poor little Skittle eating innocent....how about the innocent police who have been cold-bloodedly murdered?>>  I responded to it.  You're a liar.
The sanctimonius Saint of the News media...the back stabbing kock sucker , Jew hating judenrat Carl Bernstein...hang him first...with all the other traitors!....
And who wolud these racist communist traitors be?
Out of sync. Stubborn to the point of stupidity.
Unfortunately, the 'weird pube beards' are part of their Islamic religion....just like killing infidels and unbelievers is.
You're not a miner, you're a dick.
Oh noes, I spoke the truth!  He falsely accuses me of being a troll with 113 shill accounts, and you condemn ME.  He flies the homosexual flag as his avatar, representing an ideology contrary to 2000 years of Catholic Christian doctrine, and you condemn ME.
There's no end to just how much damage Trump is capable of doing. America has elected an idiot.
He never got cited ... but I can almost hear his friends and relatives saying to him ... "What were you thinking?" ... "Idiot!" ... "Grow up!"
Dumb idea. How would you ever start a new party?
The stupidity of people never ceases to amaze me!
Note that the fatty liberal feminazis are the ones who could never get a date w trump and cant get over the election.
Or join the military.  DoD employees go through all sorts of this kind of training... because people never lose their capacity to do stupid stuff.
You have absolutely no "clue" what you're talking about. The GDP of Alberta is 50% larger than BC's with a smaller population. The GDP per capita is one of the highest in the world. I really think it's time you put down whatever it is you're smoking, do some research and then maybe you can come back and post something intelligent and factual. not sure if you've noticed but almost everyone on this thread disagrees with you!  Do yourself a favour and grab a brain already!
I had the right to make up my own mind with or without disclosure of her hypocricy in this case.
The US government is fast achieving banana republic status. The spurious Mr Trump can't seem to help his me-first genetic programming, but the Republican party should be ashamed of itself for allowing this clown car to get so far.
In one sentence you claim Trump can't do anything in the next you're afraid he might do something stupid. Which is it?
you are right, Trudeau has proven beyond a doubt that liberalism is a mental disorder.
The state can't manage what money they already have besides putting their hands into the cookie jar & taking better then half of the state citizens PFD. Now they want to tax your income also?? These people are pure dumb & stupid!! They will never be satisfied & never be able to get their money issues under control on the road that they are taking. First thing is to vote that crook of a Governor out of office along with the other LIARS down there in Juneau that are just throwing money around like its water. I saw a case the other day, the state sent a package with documents to another state office via UPS next day. What would of been wrong with someone taking that package/documents over to the office?? The cost would of been a Hell of  a lot less then UPS Next Day delivery. This was also done in the city of Anchorage. No thought put into a very simple cheap way to get something delivered. The states in a deficit of about $3.5 billion & they can't do a simple thing to stop the bleeding!!
"The Republican Party's seven-year crusade against Obamacare is effectively over."  Yeah, the GOP betrayed us.  Screw 'em;  I'll never again vote for a GOP jerk.
Peter Stockland would you like a cemetery adjacent to your home? I bet you wouldn't you hypocrite piece of garbage! Who cares if it's Muslim, Jew or any other kind. You are just trying to sensationalize the Muslim part of the application. Whether it's the Muslims or the Indians your garbage is getting old. Go write greeting cards for hallmark as you are nothing but a clown.
If USA can not take out its own moron, how can it take out someone 10,000 miles away?
aa poor lib troll, cant stand another failed file by the liberals, the incompetence never ends and yet here still are sheep like you making excuses
Omg.....this useless t!t cannot stay in his office and do work.   Canadians have seen quite enough of you Trudeau, we would like to see you sit your arse down and work...no more Hollywood productions and showboating......get to actual work.
Our leaders went in with big social agenda items, that must have pissed off people. This is a trade deal. Blaming Trump is stupid.  Trump wanted to cancel, and he agreed to negotiate.  how about we blame the fools who thought gender neutrality should be important in NAFTA need their brains scanned for disease.
To add to my view, Putin is a racist. Trump is a racist. Most of the GOP base is racist. Most of the GOP Congress is racist. All like Dylan Roof, the killer-racist. Putin simply took advantage of all that.
_"The emphasis on higher-density housing has reduced the supply of development-ready land for single-family houses, especially entry-level homes, said Bill Conerly, a Lake Oswego-based economist who studies Oregon business trends."_  _“Just having the mix so heavily weighted toward multifamily, and very little single-family, means rents don’t appreciate as much for apartments, but prices for single-family dwellings do,” Conerly said._ ...  _"The biggest loser in this market may be entry-level buyers ..."_  You ain't seen nothin' yet!

meanwhile, he used the hurricane to get political distraction from pardoning a racist, bigoted supporter  He is the swamp, so he'll feel right at home in Houston
Complete and utter nonsense.
Time for the Supreme Court to step in and set the 9th Circus political activist court straight again. This is getting ridiculous.
A non confidence motion to remove these liberal, fairy tale liars. We need  a real leader now. Enough of the bs.
This is all sooooooo stupid!!!!!!  If anyone wants true police reform (Army reform, Marine reform, Legislator Reform, Governor reform, DA/AG reform, etc etc etc as well) they would be very Pro-Second Amendment, very Pro-gun owners' rights, and very against the State's dis-emphasis on responsible gun ownership. Cut back most of those stupid gun laws!  When the majority of responsible, moral, and brave citizens own guns, the governing folk think twice about being crooked.
Well, congratulations Canada. This is what you get for electing a spoiled brat without a clue as to which way is up. I find it ironic that Canada even uses the term "integrity" when describing their politician's behaviour.  Now the big question over the next 4 years will be who is going to be worse off? Canada for electing a known twit as a leader or the US for electing a known buffoon as a leader. Either way, may the powers that be have mercy on both countries.
re-electing the ninny that claims to be prime minister!
The FDA issued over 1200 pharma drug recalls in 2016. Fool proof is a fools game. You're rolling the dice no matter what you ingest.
Feminists often say the word bigot but when it comes to debate they don't want to hear it? Hypocrites.
An "atheist"?, now it's even more stupid since you claim to have God and Chump on your side! IMUA!!!
Doesn't matter where it came from, you used it. Now you deflect like it's someone else and blame them. It's just more trash talk like your cheeto face von clownstick and the handful of deplorable miscreants you post with.
You're using someone else's name, you're a troll.
Troll
"The call to live with Christ-like integrity" Well, why the entire Catholic Institution clergies starting with Pope F. and all his clergies except a few hide behind Vatican like 'The Tower of Babel' being silent about the clergy sex abuse of children!   Where are their 'Christ-like integrity'?  Can any of you religious preach who keep their mouth shut at the clergy raped children's suffering, this 'Christ-like integrity'? Even the cats & dogs will laugh at your religious hypocrisy!!!!!!!!  You CI clergies and religious really do not believe in the LIVING God, Christ, Holy Mary, Saints & Angels to ignore the suffering clergy raped children!!!  LOLOLOLOLOL!
Hey, Gus, you've got some people who think the GG is your own personal jinn!  I think that's silly.
Ridiculous. Debate what you want. The rest of us will continue moving forward, treating people with respect and dignity.
What a pathetic and small man Trump is. Yet the GOP stands by Trump at least as long as he continues to implement their extremist, right-wing agenda.
aa shore the paid liberal trolling hack of stupidity as usual,, trump is standing up for the usa while our idiot pm tries to force gender balance rules,, god you liberal are as stupid as ignorant of business
Wow. McConnell's a piece of work. I hereby declare this to be the biggest piece of cynical hypocrisy to come out of DC in thirty years.  . http://oi64.tinypic.com/2zfj0v6.jpg . Mitch must think the Republican rank-and-file are stupid. And not kinda stupid. REAL stupid. . But, it's the STIGGINIT that's important to them, isn't it? Ethics be damned.
Why would anybody want to understand a looser who died because he was stupid and probably mentally ill?
RUSSIA!!  Soon the far-left crazies will have a tourette-like reaction to anything you ask them.  RUSSIA!!
You know, I looked into the Clinton Foundation allegations - and that's all they are. They're not going to charge her because neither she nor the Foundation did what they were accused of doing.  They actually did good, unlike Trump and all of his fake charities etc.  There is no equivalency, period. Trump is a criminal, a crook, whatever you want to call him. And he's one not because some nameless schmo in his organization got sticky fingers, he's a crook because he's the one with the sticky fingers. Not that he'd ever rightfully point them at himself, no.  He'd throw his own kids under the bus before owning what he does.
Lying, for lack of a better word, is good. Lying works. Lying protects. I guess this is what Leftists think when they fill in the circle for Crooked Hillary. Don't forget she comes with a serial philander and sexual predator who was impeached and lost his law license. Gotta love them Clintons!
Beiber is an untalented, narcissistic, annoying twit.  The less we hear or see him, the better.
Windbag!
Who is Frump?  Apparently you don't even know who are the candidates.  But don't let let that stop you from spewing ignorance.
CVE dumped 11% on the day the Conoco deal was announced. Which company is the dumb one? Conoco also reported a gain from the sale.
What a deplorable man.
Junction City, over the past few years (OK more than a few) has gone through what the Brits might call a "rough patch."  Hopefully, with this settlement the last vestages of that era are gone and the City can continue to move forward.    We live out West of JC, have many friends in Junction City and I've been involved in JC school and civil affairs for 45 years.  I've known Jason Knope since he worked in and, then, became Director of the Public Works Department and then advanced to interim and now "officially" City Administrator.  He's bright, honest, conscientious and competent (also a "good guy").  Junction City is lucky to have him as Administrator.  I think the City now has a solid City Council.  In sum, it looks like the City's through that "rough patch."    ........Just a little note to all you JC officials.....please don't "screw up" and make me look really stupid.  Thanks, Gary
The only dissonance is in the minds of the media.  The American people know exactly where the president stands:  1) 100 % of the undocumented illegal criminal aliens -- including the dacas -- need to leave this country where we speak-a the English ONLY  2) the runt dictator of N Korea must know a porkulous Oriental will not be permitted to threaten the US -- even if we have to vaporize their military  3) there will be a major tax cut with corresponding spending cuts -- and there's absolutely nothing the radical left can do about it  4) we will build the wall and dump the monstrocity that is Obamacare -- it's as good as done!!!
Thanks for posting the dumbest, most absurd comment of the week. Have another drink Boozer.

What a ridiculous disorganisation.
Diddy is racist and a hypocrite who needs to get his own house in order.  P Diddy’s Company Discriminated Against White People- https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2017/03/23/p-diddy-reverse-discrimination-lawsuit/  Huge shocker the WaPo "forgot" to include that inconvenient info in their big news story about the SJW Diddy.
Don't vote for either of those clowns. Vote for the candidate with initials "F.U."
Whatever high ground or claims to moral authority the right may have previously asserted have been willingly surrendered in support of a degenerate liar in orange clown make up.
You and so many others hated Obama so much that if you had taken off your blinders you would have seen.  One man, not even the Wizard Trump can be accredited to the current market.  I suppose you are making a killing in the stock market.  Look beyond your hate of Obama and look beyond your foolishness to follow Trump, but then again, may a fool and his money be parted.
Racist's have to work hard at it as a slew of deplorable, uneducated miscreants with hateful thoughts in following their "cheeto face von clownstick and a handful of deplorable miscreants,". Racism sucks and you're quite skilled at it.
Stonewall, are you psychotic?
Trudeau did mispeak - he was way overly optimistic.   Tar is amongst the dirtiest and most expensive to refine oil on the planet. It will be the first to go as EV's now competitive with fossil fuels, become no brainers when driverless takes over the market in a few years, eliminating fossil groff that the pipes depend on. Add in China's 2017 in service factory built rail shippable HTGR nuke capable of replacing fossil plants at a penny a kwh, producing synthetic fuel at 25 cents a litre, and Big Oil and pipe investors are in for a world of hurt starting in the next 5 years. Best ship the tar safely in steam heated rail - at least the cars can be reused.  What the Mr T doesn't get is that nuclear power starting in Asia, will be killing fossil fuels flat out. Instead, he is a defacto member of Big Oil's army of idiots and ghouls, pushing the wind/solar/fossil backup scam, that leads to millions or air pollution deaths annually and no GHG reductions at all.
Gallant, the ultimate hypocrite. No fracking but the Energy East line should go ahead and to be seen as "fair" we will have a carbon tax.
Pure fictional rubbish: it didn't happen.    Kate Taylor is trying to re- position the reality and horror of Dunkirk amongst to-day's snowflake thinking about diversity.
Lisa will win in a walk.  You are missing one of the Democratic losers running for her seat. The Elections Division lists three candidates, one called Richard "Dick" Grayson, like out of the comic book.  No matter. She will destroy Sullivan and the rest in the primary, and kill Margaret Stock and the others in November. Lisa is the best Senator Alaska has ever had!!!
Klastri, failed attorney now Dr. of Psychiatry? Stupidity is forever.
This dispicable psuedo-journalist is a fraud. His credibility is lost as his continuous unhinged rhetoric reveals he is nothing but a partisan hack. It calls into questions all of his reporting dating back to Watergate.  Thankfully, the fake news MSM has been exposed and the vast majority  of Americans have no trust in them.
Trump is a national embarrassment as are his supporters. The rift within this country - and without - is fast approaching permanent status.  The party of destruction will be infamous as will the GOP and all those who are dumbly sitting by while Trump tears apart our country what the hell is wrong with people?  President Trump not only a traitor, he is the enemy.
Hey dumb dumb employees have no rights at work. I am a Retired NYPD Sgt and a constitutional attorney for 25 years your employer can fire you at anytime even here in liberal NY it's called employment at will you legal genious!
You are a disgrace.. and this is flagged as well.  My statement was not a lie.  You are seemingly blinded by hatred - and I think you need to step back and get some help.  Please.
Tax payers?! They won't be paying tax, and they can't procreate. What good are they? Trudeau is a f@#king moron. Dilettante.
Well then Milstead:  As one who you smear as a racist troll, and who embraces Trump & his policy choices, I'll seriously consider  canceling my $130 yearly subscription rather than suffer your petulant insults.  I'll also certainly recommend that you lose your employment at the G & M. Evan F. Pugh
Wow! what a bonehead move by Air Canada. One bad decision creates a lot of bad press. They should make a big donation to some veterans group to try and make amends.
Bastards Arseholes Tyrants and Fornicators (BATF).
Most of them are too stupid warbirds. Try and get someone to admit to voting for Trudeau now, they won't but just like Wynn you had the slick commercials and the dumbos fell for it with people like Alceste posting his propaganda on this forum.
Just when one thinks that Trump has run out of silly and/or abusive remarks he opens his mouth again.
It appears she is a P O S T I T U T E.....
Mr. Trump is a violent psychotic.  His voters seem to think that's a good character trait.  It isn't, but they haven't figured that out yet.
Really, police target vagrants in order to take drug dealers off the streets?  You clearly have no knowledge of  police tactics.   Vagrancy is a nuisance violation, and trust me most police prefer not to deal with them unless when absolutely necessary.   Are you stating police attempt to obtain  reasonable suspicion and then probable cause  to search suspect drug dealers by  claiming they are vagrants?   You have made some whopper of foolish comments, but this one stands alone as most ridiculous.
The very best part of this was Corbyn stuffing it right in the faces of the blairite scum in his party and the mainstream media.
The usual Republican clusterf*&$.  They’ll end up screwing over everyone but the rich.  Who voted for these greedy idiots? Oh yeah: Trump nuts and wingnuts.  Figures.
When Broom Hilda finally coughs, arfs up a lung, and Dr. Oladotun Okunola can't get to her with his Diazepam auto-injector pen in time, the progressives surely won’t have a problem with people reacting to her demise with the same classless, unsympathetic, uncouth, tasteless herdthink comments, right?
this guy is a traitor and should get the firing squad. This ruling tells other servicemen it is ok to desert during war.
YOUR property? It is the property of The People, dimwit, lazy, non-essential "city planner"!!! That this family tirelessly gave of themselves to make your city more beautiful, should give you pause. To think the crony "gifters" estimated what, $15,000.00, just so they can deduct it from their taxes, while the Perez' did it for free, should make you all think about what charity really is. Not a tax deduction. Why the "Lady Lavtar" didn't go change into suitable clothes and help, perhaps with her own family, is beyond me. Already put in her shift shuffling papers, I guess. Fire her. She's useless.
You are so right HC. After the filth we were subjected to from Trump's own mouth, these holier than thou Catholics who voted for him don't have a shred of credibility! They are the very definition of hypocrisy.
Because the helpless, poor and mentally ill have nothing the greasy politician's want. They have no money so can't buy vote. Hypocrites use them for getting donations, and help themselves to buy their way into heaven. Doesn't work. The churches are full of hypocrites who will fill HELL up before anyone else.
Like all racists, she is ugly on the inside.  And ESPN is wondering where their viewers went?
Yeah.  Terrible few days for the Democrats (again).    First there was the Inauguration of a narcissist, racist, misogynist.  Then the eventual, but quick reveals (on almost a daily basis) that he's also unable to do the "deals" he promised, not only a racist but a White Supremacist (the worst kind of racist), ripping off the Federal Government allowing his subordinates to do so, an idiot who doesn't understand what he's talking about, an international provocateur who appears to WANT nuclear war, etc., etc., etc.  THEN, this.  One of the guys who was supposed to give us confidence that the bundle of severe deficiencies and disorders occupying the seat of President would be balanced by someone of cooler temperament, intelligence and unquestionable character.  The horror.  Kelly is either a liar or incompetent.    Now, I'm really scared.    And, I wonder what the military has done in the past that Kelly has either lied about or covered up. . . .
If it looks like a duck, it may not be a duck. If it looks and sounds like a duck, it may not be a duck. If it looks, sounds and walks like a duck, it may not be a duck. If it looks, sounds, walks and tastes like a duck, it's probably a duck.  We now have five members associated with Trump's campaign and Russia.  The list keeps growing. Trump is starting to look like a duck.
FYI: / = and/or.  Quit baiting.  Most folks despise hildabeast because (take your pick):  Became rich leveraging the best interests of the American people.  She's a liar.  She's a goddamn psychopath.  She's a  warmonger.   My wife...and a million other XX chromosomes out there would make a better POTUS.    Free your mind.  Most folks despise the current slate of democrats and republicans.  They're voting with pinched noses.    This vid, no doubt, made with you in mind:  www.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFwdvMQHmOI
The little crap wagons are garbage and no good for anything. You can't get in or out of them, and you'd freeze to death in them in the winter. These carbon taxes have killed thousands of senors in the UK who can no longer afford to heat their homes. Trudeau, Butts and the rest of the murdering   genocidal     killers he's gather around him will hang for this.
Dr_S, Thank you for posting this factcheck. The TRUTH will set us free. Lies and inuendos will keep us stupid and paranoid.
Funny I grew up poor white trash with only one parent on food stamps the whole 9 yards. I've never killed anyone. Its a person problem calling it anything else is giving people an excuse
You are myopic and brainwashed.  You are saying… 'I don't care if this is redundantly safe'… I am programmed to resist… so I will'.    What a fool!  Open your eyes to the water/air pollution crisis in China, etc.  Then understand this.  People like YOU cause this!!! You are causing the deaths of millions of people and billions of fish and other animals in other nations.  YOU!   Because you help delay well regulated and clean N. American mining… so that the elites can dump massive toxins in developing nations without you bothering to find out that reality.    Your privileged self can go home now feeling good.  Because ignorance is bliss.  And you are ignorant.   In the real world, while you sip your latte, use your copper wired devices, and preach about the evils of Western mining… everyone and everything else in the world suffers daily pollution you can not comprehend.   And in the end… much of those billions of tons of toxins dumped by China, etc… end up in US waters.
Describes traitors to a 't' in this country and certainly all the bs 'glad handing' shiny ponies and little potato enablers of terrorists in this country! This current government is on notice to reverse its' radical Islam support and sellout to Communist China....either reverse course,have the PM resign,before real citizens step up like we see south of the border, to sort the lightweight political trash  out in this country!
And . . .  why is this news? r u kiddin?  I surveyed a bunch of people on the street of Frederick, and most people either support the Trump administration and MAGA or they are sore losers looking for any excuse for HRC's loss
Pisses me off every time I hear or see this shit. In 30 some years in Alaska we voted this shit down  then along come ass hole in the White House oh it is okay , then some ass Judge go against the people and makes the shit legal, just wait and see what happens.
Kat Brady - Surprised?  You're the legislative expert advocate on public safety, right?  Ridiculous.  Why legislators even bother to listen to your stupidity is beyond me.

The Québéckocentrics in Ottawa miscalculated: Who will join Jack Layton, Jim Flaherty, Rob Ford and Jim Prentice in the dustbin of history? Wall Street hipsters speak another lingo: There’s no free ride because in the end somebody always pays. The organ–grinder of the world thus cranks a heady tune: When the bloody cacophony ends this time around, who will be caught without a sofa–chair? The wheels of history are greased with magic sauce ...
No need for refuting since everything you claimed is absolute nonsense.  All you did was regurgitate the pipeline propaganda without any foundation in fact.  The local Sioux have lived there for a lot longer than the oil invaders and know about the history and archeology related to their own people.  You must be one of the oil slime joining Pluto as a mouthpiece for the Texas Oil Monopoly.  "Liberal Nazi" is right out of that White Supremacist/Limbaugh/Fox News dictionary of oxymoronic falsity.  Enjoy your fat salary from the Oil Barons while it lasts.  They will jettison you just like all the rest of the loyal propaganda trolls filling the opinion pages.
What an interesting story ?  Consider this ,  When a dog  bites  human, it is  considered NORMAL,  but  when a human  bites  a dog  it is considered  ABNORMAL.  In other words,  Please  STOP encroaching BEAR SPACE  with your stupid class projects.
As this article noted, Macron would not release Trump's hand.  Yet Trump is cast as the villain.  "Araud rolled his eyes and gave a smirk...." in describing Trump.  This describes quite well how the smug, arrogant MSM unfairly patronizes the president.  Lyman Hall correctly notes in his post that this unfair journalism only gives more support to the president.
Searched in vain for an idiocy emoji to react to this comment. Alas, couldn't find one.
What's wrong with being rich and a winner. Better than being a poor loser.
What kind of BS scam is this? This lawyer is a crook in my opinion. He wants dispensaries to be legal in Creswell but only if he's the only one??? Literally makes me throw up. Support good dispensaries not exploitive corrupt ones. What a disgrace.
I hope he refuses a carbon tax., or shall I call it the Butts stupid tax.
Price is good but all this best in the world from talking heads like to morons on Fan590 is utter bull shit....goalies in the NHL take turns at being best - there is no best in the world - yesterday Lunquist was best in the world. Tonight, someone else. Price is good but so are a dozen others.
my god you love spewing the complete bull of stupid, , how does trump not respect democracy when its the left lunatics like you that are not respecting the election? ,,  his presidency is in good faith loser, just cause you nut jobs dont think so, doesnt make it so,, ,, and again with the russia fantasy,, i guess you have not been watching news this week where now even the alt left lunatics like rachel maddow are saying there was no russia collusion,, why? cause there wasnt any you FKEING idiot
Sure, Old Fool, I'll get working on that. We can start by breaking up the education Cartel of self-dealing crooks who are stealing more money every year from tax payers, giving themselves raises and leaving all of the poor kids in the area with a low-quality education. It couldn't be more obvious that these fools have no idea how to increase student achievement, but now Baldy isn't even going to try?   Anyone unfortunate enough to have been anywhere near the education industry knows that Baldy is just riding the latest fad of Social and Emotional Learning. They know that there won't be a test measuring this latest fad's success, so job well done!
The "useful idiots", being the likes of "Chris from/in Ottawa, and "Cassandra" are strangely absent.
This whole Paris agreement is just dog whistle language for "We hate poor people", especially the ones who live in Africa.
You are an ignorant American, a dime a dozen, who doesn't know the law or anything more than someone who live 1,000 years would know. You're primitive.
Pray tell how does a dead man sign there requested documents ?  He must know when he is going to die...stupid Where he-she worked for the government and they all should be available to the public... period...  bought and payed for  by us..
Somtimes, there are just stupid people out there.
10% of NYC is drugged out on heroin and cocaine; 1/3 are on welfare; 100s of thousands are illegal aliens; and that idiot Schumer thinks that stopping chocolate huffing needs his high level attention.
That's a silly comment, even by your standards.
What an idiotic remark.
They call him eminem but he aint no candy, to me he nothing but sad slim dandy, making words rhyme and selling out his soul, don't make him an expert, just a rapping troll.
If this is just another crazy gunman, as opposed to an act of terror or hate-crime, then I'm not saying anything about it except to say that if Americans can't enact sensible gun laws then basically they don't really care about these mass-shootings very much.  So why the hell should anyone else care?  There is a difference between a common-or-garden American mass-shooting versus a hate-crime or act of terrorism.   I care more if it's a hate-crime or act of terror.  A common-or-garden mass-shooting in USA is a problem due to non-existent or insane lax gun-controls and the crazy gun-culture in America more than anything else, including mental-health. These mass-shootings are inevitable in a society full of guns. Since Americans don't seem to care about proper gun-control, I therefore have little sympathy, apart from for the people directly affected, when this happens in America. It's their own goddamn fault.
You are correct. Savings provide the funds for investment. Among the most basic economic equations is S=I. Only an economic imbecile would think savings just pile up as dollar bills in some corporate office or in a bank vault and are thus sterile. Most people have the capacity to understand this concept and reject true Keynesian theory as specious.   This rejection of gave rise to Neo-Keynesian economics: the notion that government intervention can be used to control economic outcomes and smooth boom/bust cycles.
Why would they admit these immature ridiculous Canadian trouble makers?
Trudeau and Notley can take a bow. This should work wonders for foreign investment in Canada and will likely accelerate the exodus of energy investment $$ already here. Bring on the tax increases! We are a country governed by idiots.
How do morons like Vicki Marble get elected?
I guess when he answered that climate change was a myth. The reporter naturally assumed he was dealing with an idiot. So sure Santa Claus, Easter bunny, all of that's good. Tooth fairy?
Hhahahha... we have now reached critical mass stupidity. Write a historical figures name that G&M don't like and you get censored. If I write Winston Churchill, that won't get censored I'm sure. But if I write K__________i, wooooooo....
Maximus,  I don't think you understand native history very well. The founding fathers used the five tribes as a model example for creating a democracy here. Along with lots of other enlightened philosophies coming to light,  I don't think the natives fought more wars with themselves then Europeans fought wars by themselves.  That is a stupid comparison.   Also, I'm sure if you we're black and imperialists came wanting laborers, you would sell out the weaker tribe in your area...... racist prick..
Trudeau is a pathetic weasel with no backbone and a willingness to lie.
I'd rate the performance of Siemian, the coaches, running backs, offensive line, defense, special teams, receivers, heck, the entire team and organization in every respect as poor, uninspired, lacking focus, imagination, skill and drive. I'd rate them as a bottom third team from coach to kicker - without exception.  I'd also rate your infantile name calling as below childish, more brain-dead-moronic in fact. Your "EloTroll" gibberish is as lowbrow as your idol, Donald the "Orange-u-Tan ape" commander in chief of the White House of Horrors. See, anyone can do it, better than your immature tripe, difference is, I'd do it to your face... something you'd be too chickenspit to do.
"The United States is the stupidest country in the world." Hmm. I'm not sure how a country can be stupid but how does it feel to depend on the "stupidest country in the world" for your economic and physical security? I guess that makes a protectorate like Canada brilliant! LOL. Funny stuff.
All this is just a part of the Obama "resist" movement. If in fact the protest was real instead of manufactured, someone would actually come out and offer a solution. If police brutality is the issue then what is the solution? All African American police? No police? Remember these are rich players along with even richer owners telling us to stand and lock arms for unity. How bout standing with hand over heart in unity? If you think the left is not trying to destroy every solid aspect of what is "America" then you haven't been listening. Obama and Jesse Jackson had two lifetimes to attempt o fix Chicago's south side. They both got wealthy over it. and the south side got worse. Remember Hillary's thesis on Saul Alinsky folks. Useful idiots
This has got to be one of the most ignorant and stupid articles I have read. The author of this article just offended a huge segment of the population, but then again, when you write for a free cage liner like WW, then I guess you can be an idiot.
Its pretty serious to move from one country to another (from someone show has done just that.)  I doubt many if any of the anti Trump types from USA will move here and also doubt many will flee Canada due to Liberal policies here.  Agree with Skeptical on just about everything else. There is no need to poke a stick in the eye of a USA administration that will soon be headed up by a paranoid individual. No-one is saying that we can't visit Cuba but why do it at this exact time? Dumb.
And an adulteress!
More misrepresentation from the climate change cultist handbook.  China will happily sell solar panels and wynnemills to useful idiots.
Ewwww! That's disgusting.  Are you from Nanakuli or something?
Just don't be dumb enough to rent a house to them!
I didn't know Jesse Jackson or Rev sharpton were racist  I just thought the just cared for black perpetrators  Loser Don't cry 😭 just bullying  You
The "so called" President is real scum, he has been his whole life, but he could get away with it cause he was surrounded by family ( which he is doing IN the WH our of necessity) who put up with him, AND he managed successfully to bully his way around thanks to the very deep pockets of his daddy.  Scum finds scum, and he is surrounded by a cess pool of his own type..scum.  Finally, he is every day being subject to real scrutiny....and my prediction is a man of such low character cannot and will not survive the scrutiny that comes with the office he has astonishingly achieved.
That's why should high only college grads. They can multi-task. High school is just stupid rote memorization.
malignant old man? or is it the fact he  does kiss your butts and treat you like the over bloated egos think you deserve! please you have become a disgrace nationwide for your national enquirer reporting mens bathroom wall graffiti!
"All our self serving idiots are in Alberta and there aren't enough of them."  What an attitude. Oh, there are conservatives coast to coast to coast as seen during the Harper era. Alberta is very diverse now - we have people from across Canada and the world. When you smear Alberta, your smear may be against people from your own home province who came to Alberta for "work" and live well.  It is time to look at unions in Canada. Do certified professions like teachers, nurses and other public service professionals need unionism? No. The government can set a sliding wage scale and increased pay should just not equate with how many hours/years on the job but the QUALITY of the work - just like in the private sector. Occupations that don't require specialized education need unions to protect worker rights.  O'Leary points are spot on: we shouldn't be importing oil products from the Saudi regime. We need to balance industries and build pipelines to fund the social net that makes Canada tick!
This shows how stupid he was in the first place, The indicators to raise just were not there
Leave it to a republican to politicize what will more than likely turn out to be a  tragic event. Good job, moron. I'll bet your parents are proud.
Disgusting Kielbergers profiteering.
The author is just jealous because she doesn't have a passage like this in HER scripture:  “And kill not your children for fear of want.  Verily We shall provide sustenance for them as well as for you. Surely, the killing of them is a tremendous sin”--(Qur'an, al-Isra’ 31).  May I suggest she refrain from pontificating on al-Shari'a--or indeed any topic for that matter--until she's taken the trouble to learn something of them.  But I thank her for putting the Shari'a comment at the beginning of her piece.  Saves me the trouble of reading the rest of her willfully ignorant, bigoted drivel.  Khalas.
Foolish drivers do cause wrecks, they either believe their four wheel drive is a magic carpet or that they can never ever make a mistake or that they will live forever no matter what. The more mortal drivers are driving way slower when those nimrods come on to your bumper like they got diarrhea and have to get home. Do yourself a favor to those who travel the roads with you, crap in your pants and live to crap another day!
your post one of the most pathetic alt left cry baby ignorant posts of the day!,, trump stands for reality and loser even china and india are not taxing themselves on this scam as niether are the majority of countries signed on to this useless nonsense photo op deal
Trump is a rat.
Fool, I am talking about far more than just that.  You are stuck on what you think you know.  There is far more to that post than you even understand.  Besides that, your other posts are just laughable.   Be gone!
Katrina, you moron. Mexican troops fed thousands of Americans a day
Take your "antifa" and BLM nonsense and get out of the USA.  You are a loser.
Everything that the idiot in chief touches turns to s--t. What General Kelly and other White House staffers need to remember if you hang around with s--t for too long you get immune to the smell. You need to leave before you can't tell the difference between a fragrance and a stench. 🤔
This idiot and Colbert should face the same consequences for their verbal diarrhea and mental constipation.
Oh Jared, you are are making your daddy and daddy-in-law so proud. You're a real chip off the old crook.
One more reason to vote for Trump.  The UN parasites fear him.
See a lawyer so you know your rights right now. This guy is not worth it. As Dave has suggested, he is a 'dog'.
You're right, SB, so long as the bunch of cheap socialists aren't so stupid as to tweet that all those who call themselves refugees from anywhere in the world are  welcome to come to their country and then hundreds or thousands of phony refugees from the Muslim world begin flocking illegally across their border, up to half with criminal records, and the national police respond by helping them with their luggage.  But since nobody could possibly be stupid enough to cause this to happen, then the US has nothing to worry about.  Mind you, the potential upside for the US in this insanity is that most of the bad guys coming here in this refugee tide are coming from the US so we are thereby helping them get rid of their potential Jihadists.  Unless, of course, they just use Canada as a staging ground to plan and prepare for strikes on US soil.
Why don't you do some research before posting such nonsense?
Sounds like the Jamish Mafia is in the surf/drug/rape/real estate business. Have the fed investigate anyone who has a Jamish-sounding name. Those filthy dogs are everywhere.
I believe the FBI is already investigating those damn Democrats as they certainly have their eye on Hillary. Maybe we will find out what some of those unexplained millions of Clinton foundation dollars are really being spent on? If I find out some funds are going to paid trolls for democrats I will let you know ASAP so you can bill them.
"I misspoke the way I should have said it"  Political speech for, "I'm an idiot and I got caught in my lie to one part of the country by another part of the country."  I was just happy to see Calgary booing our selfie seeking PM.  Some where in Quebec there is a village that is missing it's idiot and we need to get him back to them before he completely ruins this country.
There is no hypocrite like a "God fearing", bible thumping, flag waving, against-rights-for-other-people, do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do HYPOCRITE.
Trump is doing right things, he is great President, a lot better than 44th one from Kenya  Lot of good people support Trump, only crooked and dumb people against
These scums will not be forgotten.
you must be on meth...wow what a load of bullshit
Complete and utter losers
....Actually you're implying that Reimer is better, or why make such a useless commemt?...(where is the ignore button???)
Sad!!If police say they don't think it's drug or gang related I wonder if we have some fool just going out an shooting folks for the hell of it!! Idk just a thought!!
Even when you provide the website that proves Harper only added 120 billion to the debt you still claim he added more than 150?   This is lame. Just lame.  I'm still trying to process how you think any surpluses Harper had should be credited to the debt. That's quite the doozy.  No wonder an idiot like Zoolander got voted in to create our present mess.
"Just one spill near the tribe's reservation could release thousands of barrels of crude oil contaminating the tribe's drinking water" FALSE! The pipeline has spent millions to relocate the intake pipe for the reservation way upstream from where the oil pipeline will be buried crossing the river, which is NOT on tribal land, but owned by the State and Federal Government. I like Tulsi too, but this time she is chosing the wrong side, and her facts are incorrect.  She will end up looking silly.
And now that idiot is "consulting" (read scamming) people via his New York office.
GPF: How long have you been an idiot?
Yo, Great Big A.  Isnt the internet great? It captures all of your key strokes. Hypocrisy as spoken in your own words: "...AHAHAHAAHAHAAHAHAHA No need to get all angry over it. You're a bigot like everyone else in here.... big·ot..." GBA, Sept 25, 2017
Are we seeing evidence that Justin is a both an influence-peddling crook and treasonous in selling Canada out to a thinly-disguised communist enemy waging economic war on Canada and the entire West?  That someone so lacking in moral fibre, a failure in everything he touched before he was anointed by a cynical and corrupt Liberal party,-- could have been allowed to hijack the leadership of this country makes a damning statement on our political system.  Canadians will be watching the United States closely, for if President-Elect Donald Trump succeeds in delivering on only a fraction of his promises, we will be demanding the removal of the garbage we have in Ottawa, and either seeking a complete re-working of our antiquated and dysfunctional system of government,-- or as many Westerners are discussing, union with our closest friend, ally and largest trading partner, the United States.
I started posting here because I needed to say my horrors about the Catholic Institution clergy’s sex abuses of children.  I am one of those mothers who suffer through family member’s the devilish suffering from rape for twenty years.  For me, I am not sure if a child horrendous suffering from rape is more horrible or the CI (Catholic Institution) clergies continuing betrayal of hiding and condoning clergy sex abuse of children is more horrible.     So the most of my posts are quite negative.  My overall sentiment is ‘over my dead body any of you clergies will rape children and get away with it’!!!    Either CI will reform or it will die.  No matter what it will be better than the way it is now, since right now we are worshipping more of ‘d*vil’ with ‘d*vil’.   I sense CI is already too corrupt to reform.    God have mercy on us!!!
This guy is a complete shill.  What was he watching today?  Trump was completely vindicated, you look the fool
Maduro is an uneducated ex-bus driver thug running a narco-dictatorship. Maduro was trained in Cuba. He has no economic knowledge or philosophy (other than controlling and remaining in power).  No "socialist" starves his people while paying 20% interest on bonds to Wall Street.
"There’s a sucker born every minute," so the old saying goes, eager to put their trust (and money) in the hands of a fast talking con man.
I was abused as a child but you didn't see me go to school and kill people that bullied me... why because I'm not a punk bitch... he should be put in the gas chamber.
Mr Summers:  You are living proof that we are in an era when the message is irrelevant.  All that matters is the messenger.  If I consider myself to be on the right wing, then anything said by a fellow right-winger is, by definition, correct and okay and everything said by a left-winger is, by definition, stupid, foolish and unworthy of consideration.  The same is true of left-wingers.  It does not matter the message.  It does not matter if it's the same message from both sides.  It's so much easier to claim the person is a stupid head than to actually think.  Thinking is hard.
Wait you think this prove Clinton was doing illegal shit?  Thank god I have brain, I would hate to be you.
Abbot and the Texas GOP are disgusting.
You do realize that all those revolutionary radicals and romanticized rebels, once they get a taste of real MONEY, basically become "Old, straight, white males" right???  Fidel, Carlos Slim, Robert Mugabe, Jacob Zuma, Hugo Chavez, etc etc etc...
Yakabuski lost all his credibility with his biased and wrong 'analysis' during the election season.  This 'Manchurian' thesis, while popular on far-left blogs and sites, just illustrates how foolish Yakabuski writes and how silly the Globe has become.
I love Trump because it makes parasites like you spin.
So it's fine with you that an ignorant blowhard wings it in making threats that could lead to war. Ugly stuff!
It would suck to lose a teenage son to street violence.  It would suck to be such a stupid  POS of a parent that my son is dumb enough to be around people who would kill him.   Your 17 or 18 year old son is dead because you are a Dumbass!
Rex Tillerson, who has tried to work with Trump, and who knows what's what, said Trump is a "moron."
Well...he has received his "justice", all $10.5 million of Canadian tax dollars.  Don't get me wrong, he was entitled to something due to our idiot government lawyers who allowed his constitutional rights to be violated, even after the Supreme Court told them not to.  However, it's these same idiot lawyers on the government payroll who were probably too lazy/incompetent to negotiate with Mr. Khadr's lawyers for a lower sum of money.  By rewarding Mr. Khadr $10.5 million, we've just sent a message to all terrorists and any radicals within Canada that it's financially worthwhile for them to take up arms against their own country.  Sorry, but we need to refresh the entire Ministry of Justice to get in some decent lawyers who can actually debate based on facts.
Ridiculous. The rebels in Syria do not have jets. The weapon was delivered via an airstrike. Moreover, Assad risks very little. There have been no consequences so far for his use of chemical weapons and, until a few days ago, the Trump administration was signaling its tacit acceptance of the Assad regime.
must have been a mexican rapist
Stupid is as stupid does!  Also, you are what you do!
The Breitbart article wasn't 100% accurate but this one right here? Garbage.
And by the way, when the "network buddies" ask you to sign fraudulent documents that say you won't sue them as they "sell" their property, you know you are dealing with real losers and scum.
Equally to be put under pressure are all the supporting underlings - the likes of the Finance Manager at Denel - who either know things are unethical and downright wrong, or else are too stupid to do the job. How do the likes of them feel comfortable taking the tainted money and allowing corruption to flourish?
The ban is definitely not discriminatory.  Behaving stupidly is one of the few groups that is not a protected class.
Who cares what that idiot thinks.
This is easily the most bullshit list of Portland's best IPAs I've ever seen.  Why?  Where in the HELL is Breakside's IPA????????????????????  The best IPA I've ever tasted (oh, and by the way it won a Gold Medal at the GBAF a year or two ago).  And nowhere on your list?????  You've got a whole bunch of garbage on this list and Breakside is nowhere to be found.  What a joke.  Feel free to disregard this entire BS list.
Deception has been part of Trump's business MO from the get-go. After the feds returned Mar-a-lago to the Post Foundation because no president wanted it and maintenance was too expensive, it went on sale for $20 million. No takers, until Trump, whose first offer was declined. So he told the Post family that he'd bought the property between the M-a-L and the ocean and was planning to build something hideous there, thus destroying the view. He got the property for $7 mill. In fact, he didn't own the beachfront; he only bought that land after he got M-a-L. He's a jerk. Sure, there are other jerks but they ain't in the White House.
oh, calling names again, fred? go figure. the moslems when they invade subject the people to their laws. they tax, they killed, they raped, they pillaged. i have read your history. i see your history, your killing one another, shia against sunni, unfolding this very day. religion of peace? never was, never will be. syria and yemen, their blood calling out, bear witness to the lies.
up front....lol.  The only thing that he can be up front about is that he is a P**** grabbin' liar!  aloha
Meawhile, the man accused of the murder of Fouad Nayel is free because of a 'delay' in our justice system while theTrudeau government continues to sit on its hands... Shame!
As a veteran, I support the players taking a knee, isn't THAT what free speech is all about?   How many of these idiots screaming about it ever served? Ever had their children serve? (I have.) Their husband serve? (Mine did).   This is fascist propaganda, to use the flag and military/veterans as props to further the crap coming out of the fascist's white house! Where was the outrage when the nazi flag was flown in Charlottesville? Where was the outrage over the confederate flag's re-emergence? Where's the outrage with the flag being used in bathing suits or underwear? NO WHERE!   Go take your fake outrage and educate yourself on the issues that are facing voters in 2018 (god willing) or how trump and the republicans have been compromised by the russians!   Taking a knee is about the disparity in justice in the law for our african american countrymen! Home of the free? NOT! Look up Elliott Williams in Tulsa or Patrick Harmon in Salt Lake City and educate yourselves!
Carl can go F*U*C*K himself.
Finally something we can ALL agree on--Mr. Lines meets everyones' definition  of a scumbag.
Trump's voters are a scary bunch.  Not all are this poorly\ educated but many are.  This pathetic white man is really not at all welcomed by the rich.  He is scum under their feet.  Sad that he thought he belonged to the same country that trump belongs to.  The election saw millions duped by a skilled entertainer serving the rich.
Whatever...Priebutts is a serious back stabber and is only about the RINO republicans and the global elitists.  He looks like a little task rat.  I wouldn't trust that dude any more than a great white shark that hadn't eaten in a year!  He is the leaker in there and they are nailing him.  Mooch hates him as he knows all about Priebutts.  Priebutts knows this and keeps his distance, lest the cat eats the mouse. They can cuss all they want, Trump is doing more than anyone in Congress by a mile.  Trump works, and can and will outwork and out think all of them combined.  Trump is trying to get everything done that he promised, even with all of the cowards and back stabbers in Congress, the media, and this news media here.  It is obvious that Congress doesn't have any integrity or work ethic as they take off 3 weeks out of every month.  They are nothing but a bunch of parasites. John McCain and Lindsey Graham are the two biggest slimballs in the swamp!
One story, 45 years ago.  Why does anybody listen to this windbag?
Keep up the pressure, John! Sooner or later, those Americans are going to regret their choice and look wistfully north, as Sophie and Justin continue to dazzle and inspire.  In the meantime, let's see more exposes of just how vulgar and pathetic Trump and his supporters are.
What a stupid, infantile comment to make on such an important matter.
You're a stone-cold piece of trash.
Gee, I don't know. Maybe you should ask the Congresswoman who thinks Kelly is racist for calling her an empty barrel. Had to LOL when I read the definition. Very apt use of the metaphor. Calling it racist is ludicrous, but you can't fix stupid.
Nothing new here. Obscene sexual grooming took place at a top model C school in Cape Town for years and the W. Cape education department made sure it was never aired, while the chairman of the school governing body, a supposedly respected lawyer, was pleased to announce re the complaint that "I think we've made it go away". Sickening hypocrisy.
She's riding her broom.
Missouri you really need to give this hypocrite lib pinhead the boot next year.
Nice.  I bet you are one of those people who want tolerance for gays, minorities, and everything else but yet you have no problem cutting down someone who offers a prayer. Pathetic.
Rep. Eastman says stupid things. The question is, does he say them because he believes his constituents will support him for doing so...or does he actually believe what he says. Either way is strange...but I fear he actually believes his own stuff. And yes, some of his constituents eat this stuff up.
I have never envied the rich.  I have enough money to do what I want to do from hard work and saving...I’m sure that 95% of them gained their wealth the same way.  I do despise the lazy, arrogant poor who do nothing and those who bitch about the rich having “too much” money...screw ‘em!
Allegation = A claim or assertion that someone has done something illegal or wrong, typically one made without proof.  The headline reads "allegations".  Even if they are guilty you need to prove it in court.  Talk about a lynch mob.  Why not just skip the trial.   All those that had Kenoi convicted before trial raise your hands.  That's right, easy to talk crap but difficult to prove in a court of law.  Relax and let due process take it's course before dealing out punishment so you won't look so foolish if people are found innocent of the "allegations".
Resistance is not futile!  Perriello expresses the same typical lame punditry we have been hearing from FOXNews that have lead to handing over our national government to the political equivalent of the KKK.  Twitler is a treasonous Russian puppet - just like Hillary Clinton told us.  There is no compromise with these twisted, demented people.  Democrats are not fighting for themselves but for our very democracy.  As Americans have learned ever since the Minute Men stood their ground at the North Bridge in Lexington, freedom is not free.  A lot of people are going to get hurt [wait for the economy to tank!] before Twitler is impeached and removed from office: that is the only political goal of any portent.  Progressives and Democrats will have to sort things out later about what is to be their new political agenda for Americans.  But first, we must drive Twitler and his fascist supporters from public life and back into the hole that they came from.
When you're stupid, the truth always hurts.
Half  of Canadians are below average intelligence.
Sexist trash.  Really?...woman are not tough?  It's for you on the phone.  The 1950s are calling and they want their attitudes back.
I would rather work with a Hillary supporter than a Trump supporter any day. Trump is a proven racist and misogynist.  Examples for the weak minded who forget too easily (or just don't care):  Racist = pointing to one of the only black people at his rally and stating something along the lines of "Here is my black guy"; asking the a black reporter if she knows the Black Caucus in DC and if she can set up a meeting between he and them.  Misogynist = bragging about sexually assaulting women and then stating that this was only "locker room banter".  Please defend any of these statements if you can. However, first place yourself in a black person's or woman's shoes and ask yourself how you would feel if either of these examples happened to you. The irrational out there, will likely state that this is not a problem and would be OK or even proud that Trump would show some attention to them. The rest of us understand that the Idiot in Chief is just that and his supporters are much the same.
Uhh...one doesn't become a "protected class" as a favor.  Constitutionally: 1. The Government (not the person) 2. Must prove 3. An immutable characteristic  4. For a class of people 5. With historical discrimination 6. That lacks sufficient political power to protect itself at the ballot box (political or market)  That's an incredibly narrow set of conditions. For those others outside this, who know not the level and depth of discrimination at issue, to "self-victim-ify" is disgusting as well as pathetic.
That's what happens when you think anyone cares about your beliefs.  And you feel you can shit on the country that allows you to get paid big bucks to play a stupid game.
oh chris you paid liberal shill of bs,, without subsidies, the EC would be toast and you know it,, ,, subs are a scam of you lunatic social engineering fanatics that are destroying our economy and future by running up our debt with this nonsense
What is really offensive is claiming dead end dead beat social parasites leeching off others, who refuse to work and support themselves, is a "homeless" issue. Curious how people like this are outraged this law was passed as a safety issue when they're out promoting FREEDLOADING as a "homeless" issue.
That Clinton shill Comey, was appointed by GWB. He is not a shill and the fact you call him one after a racist screed about how the country will be better once it we get rid of all these illegals, just proves your ignorance.  If Trump is so looking forward to this investigation, why doesn't he just go testify under oath, instead of juts tweet snipping like a punk.
Unfortunately Zoolander's experience as a drama teacher doesn't make up for the fact he's a dimwit.
Lying on behalf of a lying liar and total loser like this pResident is a "dream job"? The economy (at least until this pResident screws it up) is doing really well. One would think Spicey could have set his sights higher?
dumb asshat of the day award for this dipstick. publish his name so wave maker can launch an investigation.
What bunch of losers and idiots!  I clearly heard President Trump consistently state he does not support these racist groups or their points of view since the campaign last year.  Do these people think their down right stupid and worthless statements mean anything.  They are just adding to the chorus of the ANTIFA, Resistance and other sore losers that don't have a life or don't have jobs. How stupid has the Democratic Party become to fail to realize that throwing everything under the bus leaves them with no credibility?  Working class Americans, blue collar workers, unionized workers, middle class workers, Christians, minorities, legal aliens, legal immigrants and the myriad others that were the base of the Democratic Party are now shunned and vilified by the elected and appointed Democratic politicians.  Their shill creed is becoming the white noise on the 24/7 news cycle and quickly becoming irrelevant.
Interesting. For eight years conservative media considered President Obama a Manchuria Candidate. Liberal media scoffed it off including Bernstein.   Now liberal media launch attack President Trump on his mental fitness.   So  - According to media Obama sold out America in a treasonous activity and Trump is a doddering old fool.   Hahaha - and media expects to be believed?  No way   Perhaps it's media that is the doddering old fool with a Manchuria candidate mandate.
And you need to stop taking the pills - Trump is a venal, mendacious huckster and con man who believes himself above any laws. He will likely be brought down by his fellow GOPers before he drags them so far into the mud they cannot find the way out.
Listen you globalist, Liberal International Order, anti Canada idiot, stop giving more money to other countries or criminal organizations like the UN on top of the billions you have already given away.  You have major crises at home to deal with that need money, the least of which is your deficit.  You and your left ideologies are driving this country into the toilet.
You sir, are a liar or simply misinformed.  Trudeau the Younger simply chose not to live there, the mansion hasn't been condemned.
IDIOT
You can't get rid of the EC without a constitution amendment. It's part of the actual constitution. Good luck with that because the state's have to sign off on it and the small-population states would be pretty stupid if they let go of what little power they have left to affect the national government.
Why would any moral, thinking person support HRC, the spawn of satan?
Have you always been this ignorant and racist?
She'd probably benefit more from brain surgery, but after a certain point you just can't fix STUPID.  Then again, this is the most meaningful thing she's done in years...
aa the left once again trying to define the torys, never ends with thier stupidity, there are plenty of issues we are dealing with particularly the nonsense trudeau is doing to canada
Good bye loser.Thank god he is finally gone.I'm sure cheeto will find a job for ol bill.
NO No & NO! This merger along with Dow Dupont Bayer & Monsatan (yes i purposely spelled this wrong as I HATE bith of these very bad companies) MUST BE STOPPED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NO MORE OF THESE D$%N MEGA MERGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You're an idiot.
Walker doesn't have any support from my friends/Witches. He is trying to dismantle this state's unity and (WE) will not put up with it! Please recall this sorry excuse for a Governor! He is going to be the death of the spirit of Alaska. Alaskans protecting Alaskans should be our motto!
It's a sad and bitter irony that those posing as Israel's "friends" are moving it ever closer to absolute destruction.  Not surprised a man as deeply ignorant of history as Trump does not understand this.  However Netanyahu must, at some level, realize the world is against Israel's constant expansion and that having one friend in the world (USA) is simply not security enough.
John McCain is an even BIGGER HERO for voting against the repeal of ObamaCare !!! McConnell and Paul Ryan should be strung up by their useless feet and thrown out of office or being frauds. They had 7 years to come with an alternative to ObamaCare, but snapped their radishes for said time and came up with a LOSER plan !! Senator McCain is an honorable & honest man who called the Republican BS plan out !!!
I say let the Neo Right march. People can see them for what they are. There is a saying "It's Better to be thought and idiot then to open your mouth and prove your an idiot"
Great, an old white guy with his unstable hand and mind getting more nuclear weapons, wasn't this movie (Dr Strangelove) made 40 -50 yrs ago, or maybe longer.   Truth is stranger than fiction!
The Trump admin has lied all along about their associations with the Russians. Fake news! Liberals! Witch hunt!  In less than six months Trump has surrendered American hegemony in the world and sucked up to Putin like a little b*tch. It's a bitter time to live through.
Did you see the video of this? Trump is so stupid it is embarrassing. No takes him seriously. We are not attacking Venezuela, Donnie. We are not sending troops, Donnie. We are not going to bomb them, Donnie. We might funnel money and arms to the people we think are the "good guys" like the U.S. always does, but no one believes the U.S. will employ anything close to a "military option". I believe Trump thought that threatening N. Korea elevated his stature and felt so good that now he'll threaten any country (except Russia, of course) that is acting up.
Good question, and it probably depends who you ask. The advocates will sing the praises of a well run "rest stop", about how clean they are and how respectful the residents are. There are some land owners who are willing to allow "temporary" rest stops, and others who, for what ever reason, are adamantly opposed. There are advocates of the homeless who don't give a rip how the neighbors feel and try to establish rest stops where ever there's a vacant lot. If you object, it's because you're evil, greedy, selfish, cowardly, cruel, and a pathetic excuse for a human being, and you don't  understand that homelessness is your responsibility to cure.
a new distraction from the russia probe.  dumb old chump loves it.  in the world to control the masses, it is distraction, distraction, distraction which accomplishes this goal.
not  surprised, not sure how these isolated events of terrorism performed by psychological misfits can be prevented. Thankfully he did not have guns.
You can't be a TV news lady unless you look like a porn star. I'm not saying a beautiful woman can't be a great reporter, I'm just pointing that the average looking women don't get a chance. Americans need to quit watching TV news. It's making us stupid.
Trump just has no decency since he is a psychopath. Trump only cares about himself. It is sad since he could have been a decent President if he tried. But he likes to lie too much. Trump is a pathological liar.
Which has, of course, NOTHING WHATSOVER to do with Carter putting solar panels on the White House and Reagan taking them off. It's just an Ad Hominem attack on Carter. Once again, RD is being inane (and illogical).
Nixon's only fault ( criminally ) was the coverup. If Trump lies to Congress he to will fall. If Trump was involved with Russia, specifically the ' hack' and dissemination it's a far stretch to say he could get away with it. I don't think he's that stupid ( in this specific regard ) to have been involved. I could be wrong. We will see.
3 words..Fuck Don Young!
It was JUST last summer that a dall sheep drowned in Seward after being chased by idiots with cameras! Doesn't everyone remember the uproar? What was this guy thinking?
Enough of your silly comments.  You are not "local."  I have been pointing this out for a long time here on the good old G and M - one of the reasons rich people come here is they know they can pay no income tax, while shamelessly using health care and other provincial and civic services.  Trudeau gutlessly refuses to have the CRA simply ENFORCE THE LAW.  We had a little furore a while ago about non-collection of capital gains tax and/or the property transfer tax.  Ideally those would be collected, too.   BUT the real money is in the fact that they don't report worldwide income, or even all their "Canadian" income.  So, let's kill dual citizenship, enforce tax laws in full, tax vacancies, maybe limit foreign buyers to new, or one unit only, and so on.  Quit handing out visas like candy.  Take immigrants based on skills only, not money.  Investigate deeply when a "housewife" with no taxable income buys a $3.5 M house.  Deport those who have broken the law, on tax or any other issue.
Trump's corruption has nothing to do with Clinton, so how about you getting over it, and try basing your comment on the topic, which is the racist, sexist, narcissitic, incompetent Trump, who signs EOs without even knowing what they mean. And you still support him. SAD!
And we've got a liar who is going to be President!
@denglish4 Wasting all the young precious life in pointless praying are disturbing. Teaching them people that have different faith than Islam are stupid/Infidels/evil are disturbing.
All of this is total BS!! The people chiming in are trolls from other places and/or being paid for this crap ~ it's 100% BS
Trudeau's perfect cabinet member is from Newfoundland. Shameonhim  An admitted mentally ill homosexual alcoholic who has serious issues that  will be solved with hugs kisses and heaven knows what else
You don't know? You're going to act like you don't know why this pardon is different. The pardon and why it's different is the topic of several days worth of national debate and you're going to pretend you can't decipher what has been discussed? It must be hard for you to be so very misinformed and unaware, …bumbling from misconception to misapprehension. Sucks to be you, eh?
No $shit Sherlock I am biased! Trump is a total disaster!
That is probably the dumbest argument in the world...
Your proud incompetence is a liability to public health. Have you seen what polio and small pox does to children? You are one pathetic loser.
Ah, dodging the question by pretending it doesn't happen. How completely dishonest of you. But then, you are quite dishonest, with you pteynse that the magisterium does not change and the idiocy that Francis is a heretic.
Ummm, he sucks?
Were  going to BUILD THAT WALL!! and your going to be on the other side illegitimis non carborundum you dirty foreigner.
No fraud, just stupidity.
Most Canadians are reasonably well-informed and not stupid enough to consider electing a crass, ignorant, right wing business man  like O'leary who has no idea how to run a country.
No Mr. Crum, you have no right to tell me what to do.  It is often that you presume that you do.  Remember you reported to the police a comment I made about the killing of a professor.  I said that there likely was some personal connection between killer and victim.  You interpreted this to be sexual abuse and demanded that I report anything I know to the police and eventually, you emailed that police about my comment.  Your bullying was exceptional.  But this is not about you or me.  It is about acceptable procedure for state schools in dealing with citizens.  Time will tell what will happen.  There are many abuses within and victims of our system.  You see them on street corners with signs, living along the river, etc.  You think Trump is a sociopath.  But you are apparently happy as a clam when the system destroys lives.
Just how bad is this going to get when a university can take action against a student for sexual assault when no assault took place and the victim confirms that no assault took place. The university should be bracing for a major financial setback for making an obviously stupid decision.
Horgan is going to run huge deficits with borrowed money and punish BC's resource sector with red tape and taxes under the guise of "sustainability". The NDP has no credibility, they represent fiscal incompetence and short-sighted idealism. The Liberals are the best choice for negotiating softwood lumber issues and David Emerson is respected across party lines. Horgan is going to pay self-serving unions with a record of supporting US protectionism. Horgan is the equivalent to the Notley,Wynne,Robertson clown shows - he promises unicorn and rainbows with a willful ignorance of reality. The BC Liberals are not perfect but the NDP would be the equivalent of cutting off your nose to spite your face. Imagine Greggor Robertson's smug eco-zealot ignorance applied to the entire province and look out.
Conte is a sad man he just can't get over that he supported a loser
Are you calling me a Nasty Woman? Ha!
Exactly the sort of ridicule and stigmatization of mental illness that Wente was shooting for.
We're not " worried the probe might go away" because of Comey, nimrod.  Far from from it. This is just one more nail in Trump's Stupid Coffin.
I find it interesting that most of your own comments are in and of themselves  "ill minded comments" and constitute attacks on people.  The arrogance in this statement, for example: "I find it interesting that you don't acknowledge the faults in your thought process, especially once you've been called out on them" followed immediately by the hypocritical statement: " I don't attack anyone"  then, "Think about it or at least try to think about it." You clearly attack others.  You're also a grade A+ asshole.
Lol what a dumb headline. Not even worth reading article. Trudeau clinched the deal despite christy Clark.  I read elsewhere that Trudeau knew about this issue and was going to give in to her demand lol. Not really a clinch  seemed like more of a shoe in with a minor setback that had been discussed and agreed upon.
What a simpleton you are.
America really sucks? You know where the door is and sincerely, you'll be not be missed.
Texas' senators, Cornyn and Cruz, led the fight against aid to NY and NJ after Sandy.  They'll now put on their well-worn hypocrisy faces which they normally reserve to issues of presidential competence and national security
Your ignorance is so complete that it's astonishing you are able to write in English.
It's because he's a jerk and a racist and people finally see themselves in a candidate. That's the root of it right there.
Trust the leader of Myanmar will remind Trudeau that Canadian mining companies having been paying rents to the military for well over two decades. That money helps buy them access while making ethnic cleansing possible  That is the reason JT won't speak out on this issue.  There is no hypocrisy like Liberal hypocrisy
Too many people not wearing seat belts. Why is HPD not enforcing the seat belt law. Because there too busy looking for mailbox thief's. And the law allowing people to ride in the back of a pick up...... Way too fn dumb.
Obama is **the** "low point".  He just got called out on the racist crap he's been spewing.  Spinning his way out to the low IQ/zombie crowd is one thing...
To bad the Democrats turned out to be poor losers. Whining all you want isn't going to change anything. The Obama regime is like a boil ready to be lanced.  Get ready for the puss. Hillary by double digits?  Obama saying she was more qualified than him isn't saying much. Fore.
I've been in Eugene since 2013 and for  the two serious ice storms since then.  I have been totally impressed with how competent EWEB is and the level of service they offer.  I would hate to lose that to save a few dollars per month on an electric bill that I consider quite reasonable.  Save now suffer later seem stupid to me.
What a bunch of baloney!
There you go again degrading another person with your hateful lolo comment.  Would you like to go up to Robin and say that to her face?  You are pathetic.
I D I O T S
hey idiot from ottawa the demand for oil is INCREASING around the world, again the stupidity you live by is exposed
the answer is simple, liberalism is a mental disorder.
That one night stand you had 25 years ago, in fact you have forgotten about? She is about to become your worst nightmare. "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned." She is going to name you, ruin your career, brake up your marriage, bankrupt you, make public enemy number one, your face will addorn newspaper front pages, sympathy seekers will suddenly recall other things "connected" to uou dastardly deed. My advice to any man going on a date, take your lawyer with. Cosby and Hewitt was found guilty after detailed evidence by an unbiased court of law in accordance with millenium old legal principles. Furguson must also take her case to court. We cannot allow conviction by public opinion. Can you remember where you were 19 September 1993? If you cannot you in deep shit.
As an American Jew it's disgusting to see someone with and Israeli flag support a fascist like Adolph Trump. Israeli media and government have been Trump apologizers for a long time. It is mind boggling to see the Jewish state align itself with such a vile white supremacist fascist pig like our imbecile-in-chief. Any Jew who stands by Donald Trump is a traitor to the Jewish people.
Trump makes a historic visit to Saudi Arabia and what does the FakeNews,.com cover?  Melania's hair!  Good job SA for publishing trash.  Trashy paper, but appropriate for a Dem Party newsletter.  Look at all the BoZos just eating it up like scavengers. It would be sad if it wasn't so funny.
My wife retired as a full-time nursing professor a couple of years ago and her position is now being staffed by several part-timers.  The nursing program has been running since the colleges took them over in the 60's and has no signs of slowing down.  How is this reacting to market forces?  They need experienced full-time staff for the majority of the program delivery and continuity to ensure quality.  The reality is that instead these colleges have loaded up management administrators at the expense of front-line teaching staff.  The number of these managers has DOUBLED over the past 16 years while the number of faculty members has decreased relative to the number of students in the same period.  I estimate that the college system could save $200 million annually just by going back to the 2001 ratio of management to students.  What other organizations have doubled their management staff ratio?  It's ridiculous.
no suprise that brain washed left wing fools like you have no clue what reality is, or that there is NO living wage in ontario! ITS A MYTH.  everyone is different in lifestyle, needs, costs, locations etc,, there is no magic wage that works, but there are wages that rise to fast and are to high that destroy companies and jobs ,, and its no surpise you are ignorant of what this 32% increase is about to do to ontario
The ice sheet data has not been disputed, only by you terribly uneducated, stubborn pricks who refuse to accept scientific facts because it does not support your view. Unfortunately what I have noticed in my weeks of commenting on a few articles is one stark difference between your opinions and that of factual ones: education and sources. I apologize for pursuing an education, for informing myself about what is happening in the real world. I know my facts and feel sorry for you, I really do. You are too stubborn to realize the damage your ways of thought inflict upon humanity.   The evidence is all there, I EVEN SAID THERE IS A NATURAL EBB AND FLOW TO THE CLIMATE AND THAT IT HAS INCREASED IN THE PAST AS WELL. As does any good point, I then backed up my statement with more facts, showing the impact humans have had in such a short time. You are a blind crony part of a system you can't even recognize. You fool.
Exactly. And now we've seen the old white unhinged and hateful face of the Democrat Party "resistance". This place is lousy with them.
I guess another thing, all 19 hijackers on 9/11 were middle eastern looking muslims, so why do white children and a 90 year old Japanese lady get frisked in her wheel chair? Why does a kid with a knife given to him by his grand dad who fought on the braches of Normandy have to surrender that knife in order to go on holiday? You see, it's the lack of common sense at TSA which reflects the madness in Washington that drives us mad. You are essentially ignorance 'boots on the ground'.
Prohibition gave us the mafia.  The Drug war gave us the cartels.  In both cases the public's respect for the law and public institutions eroded.  Your stance encourages violence, creates and actively promotes black markets, diminishes civil liberties, and demands an expansion of government power.  Your post is one of the most historically ignorant, economically illiterate, intellectually bankrupt, morally defunct, and downright dangerous abuses of the English language that I have read on this site.  Please, please, try educating yourself.  Also, try not to tell you neighbors what they can or cannot do?  Power-hungry, dictatorial, unconstitutional nonsense is all you are saying.
Please! One yardstick. One set of rules. Puta si! Puto NO! How is she an "ex-adulteress"? And her serial adulterer "husband"? This appointment is a slap in the face to Catholics. Neither of those two have ever exhibited any Catholic values. Singing in the choir only gave her some cover to be the mistress of a right wing Baptist. And, Mr. Brewster has more Christian/Catholic values in his little finger than the Gingrich's have combined.
TRUMP and his UNDER educated ILL informed trolls ARE the DOMESTIC TERRORISTS!!! 🙈🙈🙈💩💩💩💨💨💨😷😷😷
Why isn't Chin personally liable for this most foolish of all his actions. Simple common sense would tell anyone that if the Ruling was issued by the Supreme Court, then the Supreme Court is the only entity with a right to judge whether what it ordered is being complied with as it intended. Certainly, not an attorney willing to squander over a hundred thousand on his personal political ambitions.  I mean after this silly show, what intelligent person who cares for those who more truly needed that money than Chin ... school children, Medicaid dependents, elderly, the homeless, would ever vote such an arrogant,  self-centered, self-promoting person into Public Office?  And why aren't there consequences when a person entrusted with Public Money so foolishly wastes it?
Or the millions of American white trash criminals with citizenship
Oh so you are going to hide behind the name of our god of war as you talk smack? Coward.
What a pathetic article!  She's a crook and a POS but we're used to her??  WTF!  ADN has sunk to a new low!
CCP useful fool.
so, you are spreading libel about him?  How this any different than the idiots that ran around screaming that O was muslim, born in kenya, etc, etc? It is not.  Do not lower yourself to the same level as these GOPs are.  This kind of stuff needs to stop.
What metric?  How bout racism.  How bout xenophobia.  How bout making fun of handicapped people.  How bout bragging about sexual assault.  There's enough metrics before we even start talking about his incompetent cabinet picks,   …his childish twittering,  …his conflicts of interest,  …his ties to Russia.  . You want to normalize Trump?  That's indefensible.
oh baloney! i've known plenty of children adopted by loving parents. you are a liar.
Chris Matthews has the brains of a cow.
People on the plane were allergic to an intolerant Muslim.
Seems chickenshit to me. Obviously whomever enacted this foolishness does not own an atv.
Bernstein doesn't hate Trump as much as he hates white Christians and Trump's followers, but he's afraid to say so.  The little pip squeak's only claim to fame is his reporting on Nixon, as if that was something that took above average ability.  Actually he's a national security threat because of his rabid hatred of traditional American values and, especially his childish open borders, globalist fantasies about a one world government that is so nonsensical only a fool could ever entertain the idea, let alone work for it as if it's the most important thing in the world.  His kooky, insane ideas belong in a grade school classroom.  Personally I'd like to see him culled from the population by jailing him as a national security threat.  He's a worthless fool.
Ok a sales tax with no limits and no exclusions.  You buy a house for $500,000. and pay a 10 percent sales tax = 50K.   You buy a car for $40k - 4K sales tax. Sure let's do it. Except for one thing...people will do everything they can to get around it....buy online, buy out of state, many businesses will go belly up. All businesses will buy everything outside. Stupid idea.
not a failure of government? what are you on, stupid pills???? ITS government that has NOT ALLOWED developement loser
So you want Canada to become the repository for criminals, fugitives, all the scum of the Earth, no questions asked? How enlightened of you. Are you maybe one of those?
Hard evidence and direct accusation of China's involvement =>not even a squeak from the government.  Innuendo of Russia's involvement and no evidence rather than wishful thinking form mainstream media - all hell breaks loose, endless stories of Russian meddling, anti-democratic policies, "aggression", etc. Hypocrites.
I don't think that any of these pompous asses like Bernstein have any idea of the anger that exists with the so called media as well as the politicians. This is why we have PRESIDENT TRUMP .
Every time you Soros shills blather about impeachment you are revealing one of two things: -your deep ignorance about presidential impeachment in U.S. government; or -your willingness to ply nonsense to potentially ignorant readers.
Philip,  Heat your home with mothers earths blessings, but not oil gas or hydro electricity. Give up refrigeration and TV, They all require oil products to be made. . Give up all clothing not made of fur . Give up driving your cars trucks and motor boats and skidoos, Give up every plastic you see around you in your home, from the paint on the walls to the cell phone in your hand. Love mother earth, but give up any food you did not grow or catch yourself. Do that and you won't be a hypocrite.
Don't be ridiculous! Like all sane Presidents before him, Obama always had our national interests in mind.  This current lunatic has no one's interests in mind but his.
Just another reason not to go to Anchorage to shop. Keep it up and soon Anchorage will not be anyone's destination, including tourists! Your crime rate is despicable.
Hey Justy, please stop jumping into bed with corrupt communists. They and us will kick you out.
OH MY ACTUAL FUCK OKAY LETS GET THIS STRAIGHT RIGHT FUCKING NOW JEFF DIDN'T DO ANYTHING THE VIDEOS AND FACEBOOK LIVE VIDEOS FUCKING PROVED IT!!!!! THE OTHER GUY IDK WHO HE IS BUT JEFF DID NOTHING!! THESE POLICE OFFICERS CAN EAT DICKS!
He was the worst prez in US history.
Done watching ignorant thugs disrespect our nation. Soon most will be in jail.
I think hancock has more than a few months but I take your point that he and his idiot minions may see their mistake eventually.  But they're not very bright so i'm not holding my breath.
Pretty stupid, aren't you? No need to answer, it's pretty evident.
Dion needs to step down as Global Affairs Minister. He has been a total failure and a disgrace.
Go away Sheriff Joe. You are a disgrace  to  America
Cal, this is one of your more ignorant and boring columns.  And that's saying a lot.
stop making stuff up. Liar.
The mayor appears to be a moron.  I have every right to carry a gun to defend myself whether it is at a rally or otherwise!  I suggest the mayor re-read (or maybe this would be his first time) Virginia's Constitution as well as the U.S. Constitution with it's Bill of Rights!  I also have a background check that says I am not a nut job.  Can the mayor say the same?
the only way to get brain washed sheep;s attention is to keep spewing the lie of mans carbon heating the climate when no proof has every been produced.. you lunatics of the cult of climate have no clue or intelligence
Don't be so sure that everyone is going cut and run when things get tough..it would be disrespectful  to all those veterans we honor today.. Your remark only makes sense,,when it bounces around  in your head .No one is abandoning the country,sorry .Now tell us the truth and be brave,,post under your own name...that way we now you aren't hiding behind something when you say something so stupid..
"Good grief! The stupidity! The abysmal ignorance!" Those were my exact thoughts when reading your post about you. Most educated people wait for the officials who are actually at the scene and investigating the situation rather than draw conclusions from reading an article online. What is next? The paint being spilled was spontaneous as well?
Repeatedly be shown for the absolute propagandist  that they are, the left MSM is apoplectic that President Trump keeps playing them for the fools that they are...how delightful!
Perhaps a large number of young intellectuals (yes, they exist) have thrown both of these political parties In the ditch.  Trump was only a half dozen idiotic statements away from taking the Bernie vote.
filthy corrupt swamp
So what's new? The pathological Trump-hating  leftist 'news' media continues to front page report self-serving rumors, theories, and lies as fact in order to support their crumbling PC besotted narrative. When debunked the retractions are on page 12, if acknowledged at all. Pathetic. GO TRUMP, MAGA!
This type of nonsense shows just how far the arrogant religious PC movement has gone.  The Northwest Christian University officials are no better than the Muslim extremist and how they treat women.
Good riddance. This clown was a tool.
... 80% of Trump supporters consider themselves Christian ... FAKERS!!!
Don't forget the other fool named Mr. Anderson.
The leftards can't handle the truth about Hillary Rotten Clinton. Even Colin Powell called her a liar. Clinton's =TRASH
This forum is pathetic. I’d say there was nothing offensive in my last post, which was nevertheless deleted. Censorship much?
Which part of the comment is false? Not everybody is thrilled with idiots causing relentless problems. Good riddance
Typical stupid American thinking. So why Costarican police should let Americans chech the scene? What are you doing when murders (thousands of them in America!) happen in your country? You would let others interfere with investigation? Gimme a break. And regarding the remains, did you ever hear about wild animals in jungle? You wont believe it but they do scatter the remains around cause they are carnivors. You are really so dumb... if that would be in Sweden or Norway you would never doubt it but since it is in Costa Rica, it must be a murder. Idiots.
"...troglodytes and peevish old men"  -- yeah, no sexism there.  How about you take a look in the mirror once in a while?
so now we want liars and criminals as migrants.why have any laws for immigrants if we forgive liars and free loaders
Everything about your post is the equally the most idiotic thing I've ever heard. Please tell me you're trolling.
Less than 2% of the Canadian population belong to a political party and those that do are not representative of the general population according to  Professors Cross and Young ( "The Contours of Political Party Membership in Canada")     So why do 98% of Canadians have to be taxed to support the whims of the 2% who are mainly university educated old white men- the political elite.     The 2% can support their parties from their own pockets with no income tax deduction. We would be much better off with independent politicians rather than a bunch of partisan party whipped,sycophantic,brown nosing ,self serving, vested interest  lemmings.
This government is inept, incompetent and just plain dumb laying a heavy debt load on us  in good times.
People, it is time we Canadians start getting vocal and express our sentiments about what is going on.  I have just finished writing to Ministers Hussen,Goodale,Garneau and of course Prime Minister Trudeau.  This needs to stop; since when is it okay to cross illegally, get looked after with services that we as Canadians have to pay for such as dental, eyes, etc.  If one cannot gain entry at legal ports why is it then okay to do it illegally.  This puts a tremendous strain on our system and will not stop any time soon. After all we must not forget that these people come from a safe place called the USA! Disgusting!!
Frank Smith,  I am not preaching. I made a statement of fact. You get the ivory from killing the animal.  Your diatribe is as stupid as it gets. When you can work in Ted Nugent and Robert Hansen, you have gone off to the delusional la la land.
So Lynch will help the Broncos win SB? (eyes rolled..), and what makes you think that Siemien cannot win SB?  What a dumb comment!!!
Your ignorance extends to the meaning of "Ad Hominem". It is not a synonym for "insult", it means that one is attacking the opponent, not the argument.
Seat belt laws are for a reason...to tell ignorant people that not using seat belts kills innocent children & hapless dumbazz adults. Talk about stupid! And once again (as I see frequently on a daily basis), very few Hispanics wear seat belts...sorta like very few Hispanics obey the immigration laws or respect our borders. So now we have more dead people because of ignorance & thumbing their noses at the laws that are there to protect them & others. How boneheaded & ignorant!
I found the film boring and stupid.  But mostly boring.  BTW, make sure to get unsalted butter.
Hey cupcake, Trump DID NOT make the video, he only retweeted a video someone else made. Trump is actually busy trying to get stupid out of our country! https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/d6/55/9b/d6559b586449405a4729d8abf4299397.jpg
All aspects of the federal government are in open rebellion against their commander in chief.   Congressional Republicans are sending him bills he is loath to sign while ignoring his pleas to pass the one he wants.   His military commanders are uniformly ignoring the spontaneous transgender ban he decreed last week via twitter.   His cabinet heads, like Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, are doing their best to pretend their boss doesn't exist when he, for instance, blames China for North Korea's behavior and Tillerson comes back with, "We certainly don't blame the Chinese for the situation in North Korea"   (i.e. please ignore our idiot pr*sident).
Then "Mr. The Good Tim" be proud of your words and transparent in your bluster.  I agree if you are too cowardly to use your name---your opinions have the same value--none!
D, C, C- and D? WAAAAAAY TOO GENEROUS!!! Straight F's across the board. Donkeys!
m&m is so 90s hes just trying to stay relevant, nothing but a no talent ace clown.
OntariOWE is a disgusting cesspool, millions of dollars to house refugees, out of control government. Throw your garbage into the streets of this cesspool.
So is that are 4chan/ Russian troll friends?  Thanks for pointing that out.  I'll mute him.
How much longer is this mentally deranged fool going to continue playing "president", in what is becoming a dangerous unreality show before he is is stopped? It's time.
Only someone who thinks that idiot is a hero would call critics of McCandless condescending.
Walls are stupid and offensive symbols and practically useless for the purpose of keeping people and contraband out. People can go over a ladder. Contraband can be launched over any wall by the ancient Greek siege machine, the catapult, which can be made by anyone, anywhere. Or carried by drone aircraft. A border wall would be ecologically a disaster, restricting animals common and rare in their necessary mating and feeding travels. A border wall would be an impediment to commerce, mostly legal (see catapult for drug transport.). The wall would have to be monitored with expensive technology, drones and remote cameras with transmitters. The cost-benefit ratio would be absurdly high. Talk about the idiocy of paranoia! And still, determined smugglers and terrorists would find a way in. America, gather your courage! No matter what, all of us will die sooner or later.  And guess what - US taxpayers will pay for the abomination.
maybe this person is an idiot and none of her co-workers can stand her, not once did she mention doing any work?just trying to make friends isn't what you're paid to do
all rather sad and pathetic to see the globe pander to the uniformed
How sad.  Now where else is Harvard going to find another TT (trans traitor)?
I Agree Totally on his "Many side" real simple White Supremacist Thugs -> BLM Thugs -> Antifa Thugs...
"She accuses conservatives of being the worst offenders in the misogyny department." McKenna must have forget about Liberal M.P. Nicola Diloria's comment about a conservative M.P. being a stripper.  And Liberal Darshan Kang faces sexual harrasment allegations as Liberal M.P.  But no it is those conservatives that are the worst.
snowflake deleters, here it is again. Damn you. Don't forget, this writer works for Soros. She would have the U.S. pay trillions of dollars a year to help offset China's rise. She and this paper will do or say anything to aid the Islamist's takeover of the U.S. That's what they have all done for years. Every word you read in this America hating sorry assed commie rag is a lie. Steel on the target, Sir.
These cowards should lose their votes for boycotting. If you stay home on voting day, you don't get to try the day after!
It is time Rolo starts looking for some experienced assistant coaches.  Game after game, they are being outcoached.  The assistants he has now do not have a clue on how to adjust, especially on the defensive side of the ball.  They are making QB, Running Backs, and Receivers look all world.  It is throw and catch for opposing teams QB's and Receivers, no resistance at all.  Right now it is a disgrace for the team to even do the Ha'a, or Haka, it is truly a joke, they are just making themselves look stupid.
Jinx, you're a classic scumbag, dirty cop. Whether someone is a "felon" or not is irrelevant. What other derogatory labels can you affix to folks? How about Nigger? I'd also like to point out that you have no way of knowing who anyone on the internet is, as it's anonymous.
And Don Jr want to make "Silencers/Suppressors" legal again.........For What????...Elephant Hunting, Daddy Dearest Hunting???...WTF is wrong with this family and the idiots in the "Valley,  on the Kenai, and Outside"???????
'  HEy headline writer!   Yeah, ...you.  Listen up.  . Trump's cabinet appointees aren't confronting ethical questions,  …they're trying to avoid them and/or ignore all questions of ethical concerns. . It's what they do.  They're crooks and grifters.    They have no mores, they have no ethics. . That's why Trump appointed them, they're just as morally bankrupt and crooked as Trump is. .
I hate Trudeau and THAT is funny.
stupid comment, he's involved in fraud.
They lied about not eating dog meat at the Yu Lin festival , what makes you think they would stop with fentanyl exports?   Fentanyl been around since 1959,  so sad what the pharmaceuticals have done to humans and they spend millions blaming marijauna use.   Simply laughable how stupid they know society is and how easy it is to murder in  society without a real penalty.
Another fool pretending to be a journalist.
Well said, Elise, outlining the absurdity of the argument of transgender bathroom enforcement---Of well meaning "christians"  posting themselves at bathroom entrances to do genital-checks before entry:  Anyone that looks suspicious, 'Excuse me, "Ma'am", I'm going to have to make sure you really do have the equipment to go with those heels...'  Ridiculous fear-mongering with one source:  The desire of one small sector of society to enforce the tenets of their religion into law, by picking on an even tinier minority, one they mistakenly believe to be vulnerable to their manipulations.  I've got news for the religious "right"---Kids these days are a lot smarter than you think, and recognize the real danger to society for what it is:  The bigotry and intolerance you peddle as your wares.
LOTTO is just a tax on the stupid and the poor. Let'em pay their fair share.
So? I have pics of my daughters hanging on me and kissing me.. Do you have the link where his words were "a piece of ass"?  Or the link where he said "he WANTED to date her"? Typical Liberal BS twisting words to meet their agenda...They only hear what they want others to hear.
When more than half of Americans believe that the universe is younger than 10,000 years old, that the evolution of life is false but angels are real and that the 99% of climate scientists are involved in a vast conspiracy of pushing climate change as an agenda to undermine the American way of life, then the conclusion that a lot of Americans are stupid is not so much of a stretch. It is somewhat ironic that the scientific prowess that Americans should be most proud of is held in such low regard (and occasionally outright hostility) by so many of them.
Al Gore owns ocean front property.  So do many of these alarmists.  If they believed their crap they'd be moving.
Like Gigaba, Zwane, Dlamini and Muthambi, Brown is not worth listening to. Her and her dirty ring of accomplices are a dazzling combination of criminality and gross incompetence - where one starts and the other ends, who knows and who cares? Amazing that Dlamini, Muthambi and Brown have given up everything to Zuma and the Guptas, who are the ultimate sexist pigs. Go, ANCWL, go, you good thing!
Fuck the flag. You have no respect for this country if you worship a fucking flag. Go fuck yourselves. And the military has never once fought for the freedoms of this country.
Oh. So Aiu DID disclose his familial relationship to the Police Commission after all. That means they should FIRE that schmuck Sword. But since he did grade Aiu and record it in his scores that messed up everything. Now gotta find another tester and strike Sword's scores from the records. We don't have enough time for all of that. Get out of there you silly silly guy. You don't belong in there. What a SCHMUCK!
Really? These dunderheads are trying to protest and disrupt Donald Trump, and Trump is trying to save these idiots from the murdering sickos infiltrating the West? This crowd is nothing but a bunch of suicidal imbeciles.
So assuming the suspect is like the victim, around 18 and female, what goes through the head moments before doing something stupid like this? "Gee, I've had enough of not being incarcerated, let's get behind bars for life I'm bored."
Freeland is the first that has to go.  She is a disgrace!  Is she not the one who was crying when she could not close a deal.  Trump will spit her out.
Bravo President Trump!  Don't take any LIES from the FAKE NEWS media!   I wponder why none of the FAKE NEWS media didn't report/compare the pardons of the anti-American obama and the cliton pedophile?    Sheriff Joe Arpaio is indeed a true American patriot who did his job by enforcing the law.  something   lazy obamavermin wouldn't do.
Since you, apparently, can't understand my vocabulary and your mind is locked down in rigid ideology, anything further is useless.  I rest my case because you and the following fellow idiots are uneducable.
aa  the usual left wing stupidity never ends. harper was a leader who kept canada going well after the worst world crash in decades bud.. what is repugnant are the terrorist lovers that think we should ignore the threats
Keep politics out,had nothing to do with game take your asinine comments to cnn,another clueless sjw go away troll.
No, it's the melody from "ding dong the witch is dead, the mean old witch, the wicked witch, ding dong the wicked witch is dead".
Is the "real world" something different from God's world? Does His law not apply in the "real world"? Must God's law be bent to conform to the "real world"? Your relativism is more juvenile than pathetic.
Keep parroting those ridiculous Faux News talking points over and over...
This shows your ignorance crude dude...the are already here.  Are you now shaking in your pants.  I guess for you, ignorance is bliss!
ADN trolling to elicit an emotional response from goofballs that aren't quite savvy enough to realize that this isn't actually an issue at all.  International air space is international.  North Korea could fly in it and it would be just fine.
Gerry Guay- You are so far out to lunch on this issue it's not even funny.  First of all, since when does someone who is committed to doing something about climate change have to hang up any and all possible links to carbon emissions?  Maybe the mayor drives an electric car and does what he can when he can to reduce his own footprint.  If everyone did that it'd make a notable reduction in our country's CO2 output.   You know how science has also shown how excessive fat and sugar are harmful for us?  Why don't you cut out ALL consumption of both, huh Gerry?  I guess you aren't that committed to health... See how dumb your original comment seems now? The BEST business decision would have been to STAY in the Paris agreement.  That's why so many of our largest companies' CEOs came out against Trump's move to leave the agreement.  Maybe, Gerry, just maybe Trump is foolishly ignorant about most things and did this just to save face with his base.  60% of Americans disagree with him on this.
Trump will quickly learn that he cannot simply "scrap" NAFTA.    Not when every major auto manufacturer has over two decades of organizing their supply chains based upon this deal.    But it sure sounded tough during the campaign.      It's good for Canada to get ahead of the curve on this before Trump does something stupid.
A "real American" would reject a person like Donald Trump, who is completely unfit and unqualified to run a country. He needs a mental evaluation, and then once it's confirmed he's unfit to make decisions affecting our country and its citizens, he needs to be ousted. he's a racist, sexist, mentally incompetent, pathological liar who doesn't deserve any respect from anyone. Sad.
Flashback 2006: Senators Clinton & Obama Vote For Secure Fence Act, Bush Signs Bill  Here's the final roll call vote for the throngs of Progressive hypocrites who decided NOT to protest then:  https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&vote=00262#name
I can scarcely recall what I imagined the internet would bring when it bloomed a generation ago.   But my speculation about an interconnected future did not include reading the real-time rage-tweets of a malevolent clown while he sits in the White House throne room, having been placed there by traitors, racists, misogynists and assorted goddamned nitwits.           Nope. I did not see that coming.
Just more FAKE NEWS.   I love, love, love DJT and hate, hate, hate the democrats, republicans and the dishonest Press.  The MSNBC jerkwads are communist loving idiots...🤥
So the British people are not as smart as you when it comes to how their nation should be governed.  Sounds like a deep ecology plutocrat to me.  Keep your kooky cars and down trodden outlook on the world.  It is simply toxic.
Yeah like the Democrats don't play dirty and sling mud. I am just remembering all the bad things Obama said about HRC when he was running against her, but now for some reason he is only saying good things. All these people will do anything to get or stay in office. ALL OF THEM. Politicians are whores. No offense against whores.
Excuse me Mr. Monkee.  I wasn't aware I was dealing with someone who has  such superior intelligence.,  Stupid me!
You are a corrupt lobbyist trying to extort Canadians.
At some point these morons will run out of steam or they will implode.  Trump is demonstrating an amazingly robust defense against the apoplectic left despite essentially having to run the gauntlet alone, certainly with zero help from the possum and eddie munster.  Go get 'em, POTUS, we've got your six.
... nepotism is rife in politics ... Republicans are filthy w it all the way to the top
Great article.  Bannon is a sociopath and someone to be pitied.
"After all, Rich Little did more than just Richard Nixon..."  Do you remember LBJ going nuclear about Rich Little's "then you go say something stupid like Vietnam" comedy line?
How stupid can Trump get?  We're witnessing his stretching of that limit.  Very stupid indeed.
Suggestion Darcy?  we hear your whimpering.You truly aren't foolish enough to think laws will stop the shooing ! It's America after all. Perhaps America should supper max all those who refuse to comply, could you imagine the logistic challenges ?  My bet is if the NRA was Democratic you and your ilk would be  more focused on social economic desperaty and the glorification of gun violence perpetrated by your beloved left wing Hollywood!
The kinder Morgan pipeline is a good idea, but the Northern gateway is the most flawed pipeline I have ever seen. It is good that it wasn't approved. Putting the loading bay in Kitimat is beyond idiotic
Look at all the nasty things O’Reilly has said about liberals who happen to be parents.  What a hypocrite.
Yo bubblehead, we know who you are under contract to......
Now that's sound proof that there some ignorant enough to believe that laws have not changed in the past century.............. read this and tell the truth https://childrenandarmedconflict.un.org/mandate/opac/
SEND THEM TO JAIL/HALAWA REMOVE HIS FALSLY OBTAINED RETIREMENT AND FOR HEAVENS SAKE GET RID OF THE USELESS POLICE COMMISSION.
Clinton's have done no wrong? Press, shame on you. They are liars, thieves and life destroyers of epic proportion.  http://thefederalist.com/2015/04/27/in-2013-the-clinton-foundation-only-spent-10-percent-of-its-budget-on-charitable-grants/
.  Trump as Putin's lapdog:  Poodle, or chihuahua?  .
Correctly so.  Trump and his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, are deeply beholden to the alt-right Neo-Nazis and thugs who espouse racism, violence and hatred.
Trudeau praised and complimented the women. But attendee Lianna Rice attacked Trudeau by saying with contempt that "white men" represented Canada. What a racist and misandrist.
I love your comment! I absoluetely agree! If anyone is over 18 then he'll yes they should share the blame for the drunk driving! They chose to risk their lives by letting that drunk jack hole get behind the wheel. They also made the decision for everyone else on the road that could've impacted by the drunk driver. This should also go against their insurance as well ... Only then will more people give a shit.
The original pipeline is already there, so I fail to see how a new pipeline would "really hurt us". Do these people even hear how stupid they sound? Just more lower rainlander obstructionists (they multiply like flies down there). Maybe they should look at the farms in the area, and the runoff from them, if they're actually concerned about water quality.
Lewinsky - Who cares. Health insurance - Yep, stupid statement. Benghazi - Still theorizing for the 26th time? Maybe YOUR committee will find something. IRS - Now you're just making it up. The investigation proved the IRS action had been equal on both sides, not preferential or prejudiced. Doctor - You are repeating yourself. DNC - Oh my. Are you actually a disaffected Liberal in wolfs clothing? Seems non of your business. I"m sure you'll be taking what the Alaskan GOP has said against our seated reps. They serve their constituency, not a party.  Are we comparing size though? 9/11 - Flatfooted, and likely a falseflag operation. Iraq - Weapons of mass destruction. Not. Surveillance - There is no domestic program. That's too much data. Mwa ha ha. Torture and rendition -  Who? Me? Regulation - Who cares. Let them eat cake. Or drink bottled water. Or bail out our insider banking friends.  You're a chump and the republican party likes you just the way you are. No need to change.
He may be a jerk, but he's our jerk!. We may have to defend him for Alaska's sake.
It is a good thing for Alaskans that he pushed back against Don Young's stupid idea of a 2 million acre state forest that would be taken from Tongass National Forest lands.  How can the state manage forests and get out timber sales?  we have no funding to staff a state forest and build roads and manage it.  It is better off in federal hands so they can put money into Alaska and put together the sales, build the roads, hire the foresters, and do the work.   Also, if it is in State lands, subsistence and rural access regulations don't apply so those of us who live here have reduced seasons, reduced bag limits, and less access.
Go away troll. Quit trolling other people's accounts.
This op-ed is so full of lies it's amazing he can say them with a straight face. Wanting illegal immigration stopped is not anti-immigration or anti Latino. These political clowns always have to lie their butts off to make their deluded point. Our cheap corn has not created "thousands of refuges," that is a bald face lie. Junior has no problem with Mexico dumping every other agriculture crop on our country. More importantly, Junior fails to grasp we have sent tens of thousands of our manufacturing jobs to Mexico putting them to work. As for our unconstitutional war on drugs this has only exposed further just how corrupt the Mexican government is. Legalize all drugs and come tomorrow Mexico is still governed by the corrupt. If it wasn't for American taxpayers pumping billions of dollars into Mexico and South America they'd still be third world countries starving to death. You would think Junior could show a little appreciation.
My grandfather made his fortune selling women for sex and my father was a prominent member of the KKK.    This makes me highly qualified to be President of the United States of Christians.  Hatred is my name.  Fear is my game.  DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT!!!
I like that Richard Johnson Esq.  Gives new meaning to life and your comment, "told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing." could not have been more aptly stated by anyone other than yourself.  You do a wonderful job.  Someday I would like to meet you and learn why the planet has such  hatred for humans.  I am sure Wm. Shakespeare could give testimonial evidence in support of any argument that you may concoct.
I use to admire Senator McCain for his heroics in the Vietnam War flying 27 sorties with his U.S. Navy figher Jet over North Vietnam before being shot down and captured.  But now with a change to get rid of the "name, Obama" from the health bill, he has turned traitor to his own party.  He is a Democrat troll in the Republican party and should be kicked out ASAP.  The people of Arizona should impeached McCain.
Maybe he no like work. No kan red watch or clok, no can unnerstan bus skeduals, like da fresh outsid ayah, miss hiz baby, lik sleep ona sidewok. Only dumb kine people end up in prison. No cure for stupidity.
another idiot lunatic, if it made no economic sence the oil industry would be saying no to it bud!,, as for the enviro, there has been a pipeline there for decades feeding ships with oil on the same route, this means nothing changes, get over your stupidity, its just fine for all
I would have enjoyed this more had our great orange game show host idiot divider-in chief buffoon not done what he did today. This is his last grasping for limelight before being crucified by Comey next week. If he doesn't get assassinated first, I will lift my glass, relish and celebrate the day this BUFFOON goes to jail.
Where is the 'slander'?  Slander requires 'untruth' to begin with.  Where is the 'untruth' in my post?      You alleged that anonymity was an 'insult' to the founders. I countered with facts.    Your argument is still incorrect; i.e. lame.    As far as 'life threatening"?    Perhaps not; but I don't have any intention of inviting any low-life, ignorant, obscene and bigoted loud mouths such as the anti-Trump types we saw in Eugene during his visit or the loud-mouth bigots we see here on the R-G Civil Comments posts over to my house, either.  I'm not too keen on the ones who were damaging private property and performing graffiti in Portland in their zealotry, either.    Such scum travel, don't you know?  And, despite appearances, some of them aren't actually functionally illiterate.
Kudos to you, Alceste. You've managed to make the Duke look almost as foolish as his posts do. That takes a lot of doing!
Note these clowns have all kinds of time to drive from all over the country to sit and harass those with jobs, but cant seem to find time to get a job. Amazing coincidence
Allie still "liking" his own comments.  Pathetic.
Those guys are not real druids. They are just old hippies who are so fried that they think Spinal Tap is a real band.
Commerce Secretary Ross explained things in a TV interview last night. The Canadian dairy producer monopoly decided to rig the Canadian price of ultrafiltered milk which is a new product not protected under NAFTA.   The US wanted to send a message to Canada using lumber. Lumber was probably going to get whacked anyway but making the linkage was a warning shot for Canada.  The Liberals and the media cannot report the fact that the Canadian dairy monopoly has cost many jobs in the lumber industry. Canada's stupidity has caused us a major defeat.
Hey dunks, did you not notice the Hispanic names of the CRMINAL drug dealers?  Of coyrse they are illegal immigrants. Thank you Pres. TRUMP
Yes it is. Even though the truth is uncomfortable for the assaulter/Repugnicant.
How can anyone defend a draft dodging coward?
All illegals pack up and take the anchors with too!  You are illegal and should be thrown out of OUR country now. No mercy for any of them' get out.  President Trump will take care of the scum that has overwhelmed our country.
And all the worst to you, "poorly educated," "s**t sandwich" eatin', misogynistic, bigoted Breitbart astroturfers !
Walker is a crook.  Guess who's only a one termer.
Doug .... shut up and go away.
ya right justin, try again,, your over your little head in hypocrisy
When you post Rovian clap-trap claiming that it's actually the 'democrats' who are pushing hatred, divisiveness and civil war in this country you can expect that folks might take issue with that. "No, YOU!!!" is a terrible talking point, Mike. lol  The only people who seem to give a crap about that stupid book are people like you who cite it as a pretense to claims of victimhood at the hands of The Liberals. That's the only reason it's ever discussed. You guys are obsessed with it. Nobody else seems to have read it. And why bother? You guys can't stop telling us about it!  Right-wing media sure did push it hard on you guys and you really seem to have internalized its teachings.  Think harder, Mike.
Fox News is the meaning of nitwit.
It is all so stupid. Energy East needed to get done. Change the route to protect rivers and streams and belugas, and get it done. As someone who is against pollution strongly, I simply cannot square sending money to the middle east or venezuala instead of Alberta jobs. It is nuts to keep funding Suadi Arabian wahhabism, whichthey export worldwide like the fanatics they are.
NO !  There are no alternative facts. Go check for yourself. It is people like you, who have no idea what you are talking about that has gotten this State and Country into the mess it is in. People who think the Goverment, be it State or Federal, can spend the peoples money better than they can, is stupid and nonsensical. Politicians use taxes as Personal slush accounts to continue their carrers, buying votes from the lame and the lazy.
so you see torture and execution of human beings in China as the same thing as cranky silly students at U of T saying mean things about Prof Peterson?  I think I'd rather be yelled at than beaten and executed, how about you?
Who gives a sh.. it is a known drug running route, moron. As long as the scum are caught hopefully are thrown out of this country who cares? Are you afraid of losing your meth connection?
Angola is probably a prime example of a country that could thrive if only the ruling scum didn't loot all the cash.
its sad, the people of Ontario do not follow the breadcrumbs which should lead you to understand that Wynne is a lying crook
Sad to say, the problem with America is we spend way too much on crap like the military and prison industrial complexes.  Come on Donald release your tax returns so that we can see how you and your family will benefit!  Coward.   Perhaps then phony conservatives may look at ways to stop this wasteful spending.
Anybody crossing the border should be sent back and told to apply from America. We don't need economic migrants and parasites.
It isn't a cutback when the federal gifting is returned to a still above nominal level of funding.   Perhaps they should consider doing something radical like prioritizing their research and **gasp** becoming more efficient....like those poor schmucks in the private sector.
You are an ass hole Kizla.
They are mob whores & their children will be subjects {besides a black democrat president would have to be a traitor you don't know this?}...you are uninformed
You are a hypocrite Claude. This is a fact.
Use paintball malodorant balls on the thieves from your yard. In conjunction with the dogs, they should leave quickly.
Wow, the ignorance of this post is staggering.  Is your goal to repel atheists by sheer disgust of what you've said here?  Shameful lumping in of people from a multitude of faiths as "lunatics".  You speak of how others "infringe" upon you, but you seem to be equally lacking in tolerance and have no issues putting yourself on a pedestal.  That which you appear to condemn, you are yourself.
Leo,  you are so far behind the plate, you can't even see the strike zone.  Stop calling the shots, you're not in the big leagues.  You are a minor leaguer, trying to out think the POTUS.  He isnt going anywhere, except forward with America.  You need to tuck your tail and get out of the way.  You did not vote him in, I did. I am a retired, 30% disabled VN Era Veteran. Americas patriots voted him in, fools voted Hillary. Commies,Bernie.
Isn't that what you clowns tried to do? You are still nuts.
Your hypocritical comment makes no sense.  No surprise.
"Stupid and cynical" a perfect description for your comment!
Give me a break- we never even saw crooked Donald's taxed! Since when does every speech you make become scrutinized? The double/triple standard was quite ridiculous. I don't remember folks demanding to see that essay Bernie wrote about women enjoying rape, but then he was never vetted nor was the unfit monster who now occupies our WH. Hillary was thoroughly vetted and the best the nasty republicans could come up with was sloppy emails- the same practice VP Pense used, among many others. Oh how I wish we were in her capable hands now ... what s total disaster!
Thank you for saying it so clearly....it is indeed pathetic!
Bingo ! fasteddie!  Good Post. In your first sentence, I would have pointed out that Obama has now become the "New Fat Cat".Which also includes Bernie Sanders and "Pochantus" Elizabeth Warren.....getting Rich on our Dime! These people have no shame! In the spectrum of the political world,the MSM;ie Fake News along with the Democrat party are becoming less,less relevant.
Before the civil war?  Are you daft?    While on that subject, what do the civil war amendments say about abortion?
The only sore loser here is you Sarge! Because he voted it down makes you hate him? Wow! And to call him a "fallen hero"! This man did a lot more for his country than you could even dream of doing and your bashing him???? Absolutely NO CLASS AT ALL!!!!
Our side said from the very beginning that dem's made it up and we were correct AS WE ALWAYS ARE . Dem's believe anything the media say and probably always will because they are complete morons .  Dem's supported an Obamacare bill that our side said was doomed to fail and what happened,  it failed on it's own and once again we have to fix it.  Dem's are completely useless , being called a liberal is like someone calling you a stupid mother fuc_ _ _ to your face .
Of course.  Everyone knows that all Republican voters and all Republican politicians are white supremacists and racists.  Do you ever read what you write and not even realize how ignorant you sound?
Cops are incompetent, too incompetent to be entrusted with firearms and the ability to detain and search people. I'm glad we finally agree that cops are a big problem for society.
This whole topic is stupid. We're talking about briefly relieving ourselves. It should be according to be by your physical sex. Leave the bathroom and carry on.
Would those be the clowns in the brown shirts? Or black perhaps, with a stylized SS on their epaulets? You are playing with fire- carelessly- even though history has shown us in no uncertain terms how it can play out- and still- you call for the clowns.
Translation: Lie your asses off. Make shit up.
no, no, no, that wasn't the deal. at least 1000 to 3000 low cost units at every station, that was the deal, or should have been. and they must be owned by us, the people, not the rich.  time to elect some poor people to the legislative club, pass a law mandating the dpp not to even consider any project within 5000 meters of any train station that isn't 100% government funded low cost units. i hit the floor when the dpp, or some other government body, let one developer opt out of any low cost units for $2.5M, about the cost of one average condo in the building. we are stupid people, and are getting just what we deserve.
I think it is fair to say both parties are nests of vipers.  I trust none of them.
We should be selling off the houses of the Executives and reclaiming all their pay and bonuses they've made for the past 10 Years.  The heads of Sears Canada should pay the price of their incompetence.
Stupid is as stupid does.
When the going gets tough, blaming your former friends is a good fallback position. The rich are always telling the rest of us to practice "personal responsibility" while at the same time muttering to themselves, "That's for suckers."
"cant fix stupid-" You're proof of that.
These "comments" so far , about a  project with so much potential value to add to this moribund city of woe , are one pathetic collection of drivel...
Read this very carefully and try to understand it hon. Donald Trump is President of the United States of America. You are among the losers that continue to blame the loss on others. Suck it up.
Trump is the ultimate "sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical, bigot."
I want to be a big, fat moron like Trump!
Oh my gosh again with Clinton!!  The election was almost a year ago!  She lost and isn't coming back!  It's not like if Trump gets impeached Clinton becomes president - NO - Pence does!  Give it up with Clinton - this is just plain pathetic at this point
My name is "Old Soul" not "old one". That's low level, playground trash talk. I don't care who you support but I take direct issue with your compounding lies as if they are real. They're not. So put your money where your mouth is; I'll bet you $1000 HRC is the next POTUS.  So back it up, I'll be interested to see your whiny excuses as to why you can't.
Rubbish. Lie and deny....
Disorganized and undisciplined.  I was thinking, "they can't be that stupid".
He is too dumb to recognize how dumb he actually is. Dunning-Kruger or any other way you want to frame it, this guy is dumber than a box of rocks.
bunch of cowards do this, whether it is against Jews , Muslims, Sikhs ,blacks, Asians, Indians, Pakistani's etc etc. Let them come out  and show their faces. Bunch of creeps.
Actually, I'm calling half the voters (slightly less than half, actually) naive. Some are bigots. Some are just angry and frightened. And some, I suspect, are quite stupid.  And, of course, some are all of those things.
Chi Coms testing and probing to see how the US responds.  Do not like our tactic of putting out these surveillance planes without any kind of air escorts or backup.  Asking to have another embarrassing incident  like what happened in 2001 when  their fighter plane collided with our plane and forced it to land on Hainan Island. The Chi Coms  would not allow us to fly the plane out after the crew was released and the plane had to be dismantled and flown out on a large air cargo transport plane. Even more humiliating in the years since,  US intelligence has determined that the Chi Coms had indeed been able to gleam important methods and technology from the recon plane as the crew had not been able to properly destroy the spying equipment that was on the plane as they had not been properly trained for such an eventuality and did not have the means to do so.  The Chi Coms love to make the US look like fools.  Do not want to see this happen again.
why are you brain washed hate filled ignorant left wing idiots not seeing the good work trump is doing, bringing jobs back and fixing the obama mess, see loser lib obama opened the door WITHOUT having any conditions that cuba open its freedom!, but of course you lunatics on the left love commy governments after all,
"the utter shear stupidity of the Democrat National Committee."  Again, there must be a law for when a person comments on the stupidity of others, that comment must contain an obvious grammatical or spelling mistake.
Religion is both a disability and a crutch.
No, I LIVE HERE. The Lobbyists that are lying, harassing and attacking are only making the case better for BC to not allow you here ever to create any mess, since none of you seem to support any citizens here but act for an american company and for china, that pretty much is treason in the books.  I also know that one person have 5 account on here stalking and harassing me. You are pathetic.
Nice job chuck nasty!
To be fair, despite how hilarious that slap was, even the reporter LAUGHED about it because it was SO ridiculous, but also weak-wristed and clearly didn't actually hurt anyone. NOT that it should have EVER happened, but it's hard to take seriously. Eastman FULLY believes the nonsense he's cooked up, but even more so, thinks that we should govern by his personal religion, so that's a little more concerning than a childish legislator that can't control himself, like Wilson.
Hypocrite-in-chief. Being sexist and bragging about sexual assault as Trump did in the Access Hollywood tape is despicable and an affront to this nation’s women. Does this sound familiar? "Malignant Narcissists will go to great lengths to achieve their aim.  They can be intelligent, high functioning (hold an important job for example) soft-spoken, charming, tearful/seemingly emotional, gracious, well mannered, kind and have the ability to form relationships. They may lie, falsely accuse, dramatize, smear, cheat, steal, manipulate, accuse, blame or twist to get what they want and feel justified in doing so. Because they are entitled, egocentric and desperate, they do not experience it as wrong. They are determined to gratify their wishes and furious if thwarted. Their desire can be so consuming that there is little comprehension of, respect for or ability to empathize with the other.  They lack guilt or remorse and tend to feel or pronounce that it is they who have been mistreated."
Trolls go away! This piece is about the asinine immigration ban, not guns. Begone, trolls, and get back under your bridges.  As for the topic in question -- a new immigration ban done in a different way, one can only say that although Trump is persistent, he is at least an idiot of the first class. Nearly certifiable. The USA should worry about what they have done to themselves.  Phoning up the president of China and impulsively reversing field on Taiwan won't win him much respect, not that he had much anyway.
Started writting a long comment about this , but thought what a waste of time.  We are simple idiots and chumps.  Oil gets to market, if not ours, it will be from elsewhere.  The money will go someone else, and benefit them.  We have become the fools of the planet.
Your an idiot Eric JJP ...They dancing Israelis were very real and were arrested and detained for 3 months ....you need to stop getting your news from Rachel Madcow and Comedy Central  http://21stcenturywire.com/2015/09/11/911-revisited-declassified-fbi-files-reveal-new-details-about-the-five-israelis/  There is no question that the Sandy Hook Massacre was faked. You ought to actually research these things before you say stupid things and wind up looking foolish and uninformed. Much like you do here everyday
Troll
'Islamic' terrorists, 'rght wing' 'Christians', atheistic killers, anti-abortionists, the Dallas police assassin; other than the truly mentally ill (Sandy Hook), the only commonality I see is that they all are in truth and in fact 'losers' and perceive themselves in that way.    They are trying to achieve something based on how the media will portray them after they are dead.
Nope. They're all cowards in denial.
The only 'of course' is your irrelevance, Bobo.
A column from some random Clinton campaign worker? This newspaper stinks.
then either pay up, or suck it up...  no one forces you to buy the cheaper tickets in coach it's the dumb masses demanding cheaper and cheaper airfare that resulted in this now society whines and complains for getting exactly what it asked for how screwy is that?
hannity like trump is a dufus and a liar.
Military style training for police officers? What do you expect police to be like; Barney Fife? Usually wavemaker gets the award for most useless and ridiculous comment of the day, but you truly took it to the next level.
Too bad the Democrats cheated a potential winner so a loser could run.
The usual stupid liberal crap, but thank God for it, because the liberals are bound and determined to keep pursuing policies that will raise rents. That's a good thing, because I own a condo and will soon be renting it out.  Oh baby, are you people ever gonna pay.
But that gives "clueless moron" a bad reputation. Charlie is far worse; he's crooked (and proud of it).
Ya taxing the people and taking the PFD away  get Idea fool !
Agreed.  This diversity crap is all about politicians painting their resumes.
"I will surround myself with a staff that is reflective of the diversity within this city," was Multnomah County Commissioner Jules Bailey's answer.  Bailey  continues:  "I  will also paradoxically attend and tithe to an almost all-white fundy church that demands that my female staffers submit to their husbands, unless those female staffers are lesbians, in which case they are bound for hell along with gay guys."
Half of the junk sold on Amazon comes from China, or take a look at what Wal Mart and Costco offer to the public. Yes, China is still not a nation that can be trusted to abide by international norms. That is nothing new.
Flannigan clearly has never been poor. If you do not make enough to pay rent AND buy food there is not much you can pay in taxes. I have been in that situation as a full time employed single adult, so it is not about being "stupid and needy"
If anyone should know unattractive it would be the Donald.  He looks in the mirror at his own ugly mug every morning. Beauty is skin deep, he's ugly to the bone.
Jackie: dolts,  noun,  a stupid person.  Whats so stupid about taxpayers and voters wanting to feel and be  safe in their communities??????
OMG... the crying SOB has ANOTHER stanley cup ring! Go Crosby Go! (next year, i mean)
Being a Canadian hockey fan you prefer the Bobby Clarke lumberjack tactics. What a hypocrite.
I see how it is Talkeetna, my money's not good enough for you.  I guess I'll spend my folding money over in trapper crick.  They know how to treat a fella.   Your not the only town in this town.   Go to heck you rat bastards
Let's see...No political experience and runs for the President of the U.S.  Beats one of the most qualified bunch of candidates the GOP ever put out.  Did it on a shoe string budget with the GOP establishment and biased media fighting him all the way.  Then he beats the well oiled and well funded Clinton machine.  He did this all with his head not screwed on right?  Losers will never understand the extent of his achievement and that's why they're losers.    I want to be a big fat racist, bigoted, sociopath, psychopath, narcissist, white supremacist, head unscrewed person like Trump!
Wynne and Justin are destroying this country.Carbon taxes are beyond stupid.  No point in even debating the topic. Get rid of both disasters and careful who you vote for. Vote for someone  whose values and accomplishments  you admire. That would  exclude both so called leaders.
WAAY too little.  WAAY too late, pedophile.
You are in the minority, yet again, Alcest - just look at the react buttons and how just you and another leftist don't like my brilliant postings. You are pathetic but the sad part is you just don't realize it.
Kasich should talk - he went around HIS statehouse and accepted the Medicaid expansion like an idiot.  Then had a hissy fit because Trump beat him.  He's like McCain and Graham, the alt-left media always go to him when they want "... and Republicans agree with the left's lies..." quotes.
Why isn't the parents of the young man that broke the windows paying for new ones? Also 1,000 per window pane for that size window is rediculouse!
Carl, let me try and explain something to you. The PEOPLE elected someone to get rid of the malignant MEDIA.  And he's doing a fine job of it.  How does it feel, Carl?  Why don't you go find a tar pit to fall into, you old elitist/socialist dinosaur.
Canadian governments keep giving $Billions to Bombardier while Boeing risks $Billions in contracts to dispute that practice. It looks like a stupid contest.
Gullible or stupid, to think "take them to Canada" is meant to be credit for Canada. Canada is becoming the land of the dysfunctional, the broken, the poor, the illiterate, and the criminal, all under guise of compassion.
Micciche is dishonest scum.
All he did is declare his store a sanctuary store.  The left clearly does not have a problem with that, unless the left admits that they are nothing more than a bunch of hypocrites of course.
Rather rich when the Liberals have an eco warrior as their Resource minister, another green person as Environment Minister, another activist as the Native Minister, a multi millionaire as our Finance Minister, a zero military experience friend of Trudeau as the Veterans minister, and in today's news an ex-cop who was on the pot committee is now a CEO for a Medical Marijuana Company........shall I go on?   Hypocrites.
The ONLY collusion that occurred during the election campaign of 2016 was DEMOCRATS colluding against Bernie, AND DEMOCRATS colluding with the FBI against TRUMP.  Democrats are scum when it comes to fair elections.
It is called "Incompetence" followed by all out traitorous.
Since our stupid constitution does not allow adequate treatment of subhumans we have to go the expensive way to make life for them miserable by harassing and 'sweeping' them wherever they try to camp illegally.
Cigarette smokers are mostly trash. I am sick of seeing butts piled up at intersections. When I was dumb enough to smoke, I knocked off the cherry and put the butt in my pocket.    I still see butts when I am fishing in somewhat remote spots.  Drop a butt, you are trash.
If I was his neighbor I'd want the wack job locked up. I wouldn't need a stray bullet from that idiot blasting into my home with the chance of killing or maiming me or my family. Fricking morons like this get all of us law abiding gun owners painted with the same brush.
You are a loathsome piece of trash.  It seems impossible, but you actually become more grotesque and childish every single day.
"straightforward physics, indeed"  I'm too dumb to read this article......and even stupider to understand it...
The domestic terrorists at the company called "civil comments"  are attempting to destroy your first amendment right to free speech!  Only in communist countries or in Nazi Germany you had to have approval of your speech by your peers!  That's not the United States of America!  That's Russia under the iron fist of a loser named Putin! RESIST LOSING YOUR 1st Amendment right!  Here is the communists website  I HOPE all hackers that are reading this understand it is time to take this website down  are you listening @ "anonymous" our free-speech is being destroyed by these losers    Be a real American patriot like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington that fought for our first amendment rights for free speech ! https://www.getcivil.com
and we have had plenty of breathable air before obama's rules that are being ended.. , climate change is not caused by mans carbon thus only fools like you would believe the scam of the century https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyUDGfCNC-k
last thing you want is a dischanted player whining and crying and causing problems on this team. this team will be fun to watch and dont need him causing problems. get rid of his sorry butt and give his minutes to someone who wont complain. dont need this with training camp coming on. get rid of him asap
you're just spewing blatant biased nonsense, get educated!
I was simply responding to the word "pagan" and JFK seemed to fit most of the adjectives for that. Moron? No.
Not that I don't disagree with you but this isn't the time or place. Feel sorry for those 2 little babies that they had an idiot mother
Liberal MSM has nothing better to do then to manufacture and fabricate a critical nothing burger crisis over Trump. The Clintonites have lots of spare time while being sore losers.
Brilliant, imbecile government workers like bsdetection, whom can't read the laws nor the big memo posted in their cubicle wall at the welfare office still issue welfare to illegals despite the memo hanging there for ~25 years.
Pretty sure trump hates America, because it wasn't his idea.  The bedrock of our great nation and it's still great no matter what trump and his supporters say for their own benefit, is the legitimacy of the presidential vote. I don't care what your politics are you don't start down the path of rejecting that.   He has no idea what he's doing, he has no idea of the potential consequences of such talk and he doesn't care because it's all about his paper thin ego. This is proof enough he has no business being president.  Hillary is everything you expect from a career politician, a real shady a**hole, but that can't legitimize voting for someone who is both so ignorant and so callous as to threaten the continuation of our democracy because he's got a tiny penis
Nonsense.  You seem to be suffering from a election loss mental disorder.
Murkowski is wrong to ignore the obligation the US Senate has to consider nominees (by holding hearings) to SCOTUS.  If she does not want to do her job, she should resign.  Even worse is Ohio Dan Sullivan who acts like a petulant school boy when he refuses to even talk to the nominee.  What a jerk.
tRUMPtyDUMPty wants a HYYYUUUGE wall,  tRUMPtyDUMPty never got the call.  All the queens foils and all the queens royals,  wouldn't choose fools gold over country again.
This Scaramucci thing kind of makes me angry.  It's almost like Trump timed the Scaramucci announcement to make Pocho, lespark, and RTH look foolish for backing him.  Sure, they look really, really foolish right now.  But, they're our guys.  Like our brothers (either Cain or Abel, take your pick).  Not to be paranoic or anything, but part of me feels like Trump, in his narcissism, was sitting back and saying, "I gotta get some jollies, I think I'll make my supporters look like fools", and it's like he waited until Poch and les and RTH gave full throated support and argued "no chaos", and then did this to make them look foolish (again).  SHAME ON TRUMP! TRUMP:  Quit making our guys look like fools!!!
How can the university employ the galactically stupid?
Most posters think Trump, Bush and Cheney are all pathetic human beings and bad for the USA as well as the civilized world. ............... Polls indicate that a majority of Americans agree.
did this guy write this article on Wednesday  or is he just stupid
Stupid. I listened to this station because they broadcast syndicated national shows where I didn't get non-stop Bronco coverage.  What I wanted that I went to 104.3 in the afternoon.  I won't be listening.  I hope another local station is smart enough to pick up Colin Cowherd and Doug Gottlieb.
Handy, Sorenson, Leiken are Criminally  Corrupt...................
Pump your brakes fool!!!!
I kinda get the distinct impression that you have not the foggiest concept as to the real meaning of TRANSFORMATION Peter D. Right? Oh, and there's more, as the DSTV ads never stop reminding us all: You are going to be severely  shocked when you receive the unpleasant noos that this individual, ( a SENIOR commissioned officer by the way) despite committing perjury and found to do so by no less an authority in these matters than a high court judge nogal, is gonna get a free pass for that VERY serious charge of LYING under oath as well. I say once again: You just cannot make this bloody stuff up any more!
Wow, more scum on the swamp that needs to be scraped off, just to get to the swamp. Trump keeps adding layers
That is not "Trump's White House." That is OUR White House. Our nation's White House. Besides, Trump called it "a dump." So, even he doesn't claim it or want it, obviously. It's not tawdry enough, it doesn't have enough gilt, it doesn't have his picture or his name plastered all over it the way his own places have. It's no "dump," Trump. It just happens to be occupied by an ignorant, shallow, creature of no class, no real knowledge and no character. All Trump has is ego...and, that means trouble for all of us. It was sad enough with Obama in it. The sadness continues. And, Trump wasn't even in there. Perhaps, God was showing how glad even He was that Trump was elsewhere at that moment.
The fact that Trump got elected contradicts your opinion. He appointed a white racist to head the DOJ. He was endorsed by Nazis and Klansmen. BTW, why don't white folks take responsibility for their choices? No one is forcing them to live in red states that are net welfare recipients from blue states. No one is forcing them to do drugs, over eat, and other self destructive behaviors. Globalization is not kind to the poorly educated white folks that elected Trump. He can't change that, even with Putin's help. The coal industry jobs are never coming back. Republicans have been doing everything they can to keep the poor in poverty, breathing and drinking pollution. They are still using the Southern Strategy to recruit white racists to the GOP. The GOP is just a white identity party these days. Poorly educated white folks are the only demographic dying younger. They are killing themselves. No one is trying to prevent them from voting. They vote against their self interest.
Go back to school, scientific illiterate.
I wish I did not care, but her goes... There  are zealot idiots in Middle East who want to kill us, Russians who want to see us implode as they did, Europe who wants to own us economically, China waiting, extreme weather, millions have no jobs, Obama wants thousands of refugees for welfare rolls for years to come and all either of the so called top candidates for President can do is whine, attack each other and play Hollywood dipsticks over an election that's over. The rest of Senate and House is taking bets on who can snowball Trump and control agendas or rather  hoping for Ryan/McConnell team with Demos counting toes and a  pipe dream with oil for corporate America. Playing pocket pool with decisions that effect millions of livelyhoods and futures. While the rest of the world watches us basically submarine ourselves. And we as a nations people signed up for this fiasco with eyes wide open and ears listenin! We can't save the world. We can't even save us.
Ughhh...how traumatic for her. But yeah, you know how he feels. He told us about his privileges of "being famous," and what women will "let you do." He's a boor.
Real news is what? Lying about how many people attended the inauguration? Or that is was the biggest crowd ever? Or how about that illegal's had swayed this election. You look silly.
We are in deep feces. -------- Trudeau is full of it and full of himself Maybe he can save us
I don't want his damn selfies nor bare chest nor egotistical grin.  Let's replace this useless failed drama teacher.  I blame Pierre Elliott Idiot for weighing down this country with a failed drama teacher as PM
if you had the slightest bit of understanding of the issues you wouldn't blurt such total ignorance in public.
In Vatican code, "a stubborn animal" refers to a donkey, burro, or ass.  "Does not see" refers to a gap in ones visual field, or a hole.  One has to properly combine the two meanings to determine the term that best describes what the Pope, and most of the world, really thinks of Trump.
yes, stereotyping is usually denigrating.  my apologies to Django.  I have heard attorneys likened to catfish...bottom dwellers...scum suckers, etc.  I was told that in confidence by an attorney.
Your islamophobic statement has been reported under M-103.  Referring to your Muslim brothers and sisters as "suckers", in light of the recent attack, is not only intolerant, but it is hateful.  Don't you respect all faiths, or is it just one?
I live in Calgary and have for many years. The west end proposal is idiotic. The Flames organization wants to profit from real estate development. You can build a rink on the Stampede grounds for a fraction of the cost. And it is a big issue Bill; the Flames are a business, not a welfare case. My employer doesn't get handouts from the tax payers.
Its against our human rights and highly illegal to ever of had any drug illegal, pot, cocaine, heroin, ecstasy. The government is way out of its jurisdiction on what they are in existence for. Driving while impaired on one of these substances should be illegal and prosecuted by law or other heavy machinery just as the same rules apply to prescription medication already. Free up our police to prosecute real crimes such as murder, rape, pedophiles and empty our prisons of drug users to make sure we have room for them. And also free up the courts backlogged by these ridiculous archaic drug laws so we don't have to let murderers go because they take to long to get to court because they are filled with stupid drug cases.
This is the price we pay for having someone who doesn't believe in science as president.  Trump is an intellectual cretin.
Wrong.  You should read the story.  No one died here from alcohol poisoning.  A fool decided to imbibe and get behind the wheel.  The alcohol didn't force itself on him.  He made a choice to drink and drive.
This is a ridiculously pessimistic perspective. When you write silliness like this you lose any credibility as a writer worth reading.
OK, ... and not pay your taxes, not yell fire in a crowded theater, not license your vehicle.  Your line of reasoning is that of a sociopath and pathetic to boot.  No man (or woman) is an island, get it, or would you prefer to build your own school, highways, and runways (for example)??
Stewards of the earth - LOL, fake Christians IMO.
He did during the election but now he has a Cabinet loaded with millionaires, billionaires, captains of industry and Generals - it doesn't look much like a poor peoples administration to me. Now it's reported that the GOP is not only going to stop Obamacare but go so far as to eliminate what little social safety nets the US has, inluding Medicare for the aged and poor. Ugly, ugly, greedy self-serving rich man politics.
You are incapable of having an intelligent discussion on this issue as that would require intelligence. Time and again you run from the facts that destroy and humiliate your posts of ignorance because you are incapable of manning up. That would require being a man. Now you behave like an emotional cripple. You can't refute the facts so you go straight into grade school insults and you suck at that too.
What you really want is for the taxpayers to propagate your religious nonsense.
Trump has cast his light upon yet another biased cockroach masquerading as a journalist.
The guy is fat, ugly, and orange.  Not possible to get a good photo.
Yes .................  Canada failed when it only "sought assurances" ............... ................... especially from certified liars like Bush and Cheney.
Exactly--DeGette is despicable.
Ummm....with the exception of brother francis those places do good. You have evidently never been homeless or ended up in a crap situation where u would need those services yourself.
The main culprits that should of been arrested were Proud Boys Gabriel Bowman and Nick Robinson. These two are low-iq violent criminals.
The definition of treason contains the phrase 'providing material assistance to a hostile government'.  Yeah, I don't need Mark Z. Barabak telling me that's highly unlikely.  I know Trump and he has already provided material assistance to Putin.  Trump is a traitor and treason is an integral part of his scam.  Trump's trouble is that he's so incompetent that his scam is falling down around his ears.  Trump is a weak man who jumps at any chance at self aggrandizement.  It is his downfall.  HIs insecurity will take him down.  It's his most dominant characteristic and it will end his scam.
What a douche.  Dems always get a pass.  It's the hypocrisy of these clowns that drowns out their message.  Don't want to hear it.
If he had any feeling for just normal Canadians he would resign immediately ! He's taking us to the Poorhouse with his and Wynnes stupid policies ! Canada has a 2% impact on carbon footprints!- and Wynne has screwed Ontario with her Hydro plans ! Is it all the Immigrants voting for them ? It sure can't be Canadians who have paid their taxes for years !
"...The United States has this problem with income inequality, perhaps you've heard of it. It is at the center of this healthcare issue as well..."   "Income inequality" is the most stupid, ridiculous concept statist elites throw around as if they can do anything about it. The simple fact is that the world consists of stupid people, lazy people, uneducated people, ignorant people, smart people, motivated people, educated people, and knowledgeable people. People are all individuals.  As long as everyone is permitted to follow their own paths and protected by the same laws, government has done all it should.  It is called equality of opportunity not equality of outcome.
Trump and his team are pathological liars. Why would anyone, anywhere believe anything they say?
The new system is garbage.
IN YOUR STUPID RACIST MIND they're all "GHETTO PLAYERS" aren't they, you racist sack of shyt? You don't know ANYONE'S background but in YOUR SICK MIND they're all on DA WELFARE!  FOK YOU.
Nothing made me happier than listening to the desperation in Romneys voice as the lying hypocrite tried to kick sand on Trump. Romney the guy who made his money tearing things apart against Trump who made even more money building things. The more the establishment continues to panic and sabotage Trumps campaign the more We can be assured that Trump is the right man for the job.
So very true, Dimly. Would add : Doesn't know. Ignorant. Extremely, rather dangerously, narrow minded. Misinformed. Gullible. Uneducated (just like Trump's followers). Full of rage and hate. Violent revolts taking place? Where/when/how? Details please.
No different than the Russian hacked DNC E-Mails release,  both illegal, but  just watch the sore losers cheer this on....
Folk hero my back end....McCandless is no hero, just an ignorant fool who got killed because he had no appreciation of the danger found in mother nature and did not take precautions or have a viable survival plan.  In many ways his should be looked as a suicide by a mentally ill person.   Starving to death in a blighted bus is not hero material.
It isn't even that Equifax who monitors people are corrupt and criminal... it's the Government in Canada and the U.S. who sit IDLE and not do ANYTHING about this OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!!   YOU IDIOTS!   ... look... what do you think the problem is?  Is it that Equifax has personal data?  Or that they have it online?  Why does ANY COMPANY IN THE ENTIRE WORLD be required to store data online?  Each and every excuse as to when and where data should be stored by every IT dept is completely bogus!  Here is an idea.   ANY INFORMATION that is stored online by any organization immediately be completely isolated.  I can tell ANYONE how to do that in 5 minutes.  Here is an idea.  The SEC and the Government in Canada and the US immediately freeze all of EQUIFAX assets, and those of EVERY BOARD MEMBER and OFFICER.  There is more damage done that this pathetic company is worth.  Nothing will be done... no surprise.  Nothing.  The only thing more pathetic than another stupid hack job is you.  You!
Only an idiot would end it at Middle Street.  And you don't even notice the surcharge.
Comparing apples to oranges. Obama adhered to protocol. And for you to blame Obama for today's mess is laughably ignorant.
looks like you don't understand the subject just by reading your ignorant rant. How has the softwood issue been resolved by past liberal and conservative governments? Did they not understand the subject either?
The baker discriminated against the gay couple. That is a fact, the baker's lawyers agree that he discriminated against the gay people. You are arguing that the baker should be allowed to discriminate. If the baker is successful he could then fprefuse to serve black people and claim it would be against his religion to do so. A pharmacist could refuse to serve the elderly because of his religious beliefs.   Are you,still saying that the baker did not discriminate? lol
Must have been a committee decision - nobody is that stupid.
While we all wait, praying every time he opens his mouth that he doesn't say something really stupid.
The morally bankrupt status quo - elitist politicians, propaganda-house media, and corporate-run political parties got us Trump.  There really is no comparison.  Trump is a white knight in dented, rusty armor.  We could have had a Perot, or a Ron Paul, or even a Rand Paul, but Trump is the best our dumbed-down, media-addicted/addled population can afford, and currently also the best we deserve.  Deal with it.
That is a pipe dream unless you live in a warm climate. And do you intent on heating our house how. The idiot Liberals in Ontario have sent the price of electricity sky high through their mismanagement. Liberals totally not fit to govern
. . . only fools trusted them before all this.
No! You would like to change the subject wouldn't you just to divert attention from your ridiculous  comments.
I really get a kick out of it when different parts of the lugenpresse complain about each other.  They are so scummy and deceitful it's like drinking fine wine when they finally get aimed at the right target.
.  Trump and Netanyahu, just a couple of carny hucksters and low grifters looking for more suckers to reel in.  Which one has the more ridiculous comb-over?  .
The lying attacking press needs to get off Trump's back. Bernstein needs to shut up
Nunes is the dumbest thing to come out of California since dianetics.
I just don't get it.  Are there Republican policy wonks who sit around a table conjuring up actions to take solely intended to mess with people's lives in a negative way?  "Let's all see whom and how we can hurt the most today!"  The twisted alphabet soup of agencies and programs that are being cut/eliminated/reduced have real impact on actual people.  Is there a list somewhere of those next on the Gov's chopping block?  What is the Fed going to DO with this land they are so cavalierly repossessing -- from those who have a long history of being oppressed and lied to by the same Fed?  Are there undeveloped resources out in that desert that are crying out to be exploited?  What is the freaking purpose of all this rape and pillage being methodically undertaken by the Trump administration?  I think I need some right-wing mansplaining, and darn quickly, because this (et al) just seems shockingly stupid.
Every time you think you've seen peak stupidity out of this crew, they get dumber.   Our democracy may remain intact not through the action of even a single non-crooked Republican lawmaker, but because the crew threatening it apparently alternates their strategy meetings with huffing paint vapors.
No one is comparing "spoiled" "black" athletes to our "Good" (are you high on crack cured in lead paint?) "American" president. Straw man alert! Racist alert!
Somebodies a liar. Do you think it's General kelly?
Merkel is a lame duck, lets hope Trump doesn't waste any time on her.
Two of the top educational systems in the world are in Singapore and Finland. They have for many years destroyed the US in terms of student outcomes.   Singapore has a highly structured top-down system with  tightly scripted control of curriculum and testing for all students from the central government. Finland has a similar approach - there is no such thing as a private school - and many credit its success to 1) placing a high national value on the teaching profession and paying teachers accordingly and 2) paid high-quality universal preschool and daycare for all kids ages 3-7.  Neither country touts "school choice". They have committed to, and invest appropriately, in a consistent and top notch universal education for ALL of their country's students.    But don't let facts get in the way of your effort to tear apart the US educational system. Carry-on with your ignorance...
If they have a no discount policy, they can stick their tesla's up their collective asses - who cares what their policy is - buyers expect to be able to negotiate - so no tesla for me which is fine - lots of choice out there and better value - see ya tesla - nice cars but don't believe in your stupid policy
Because he is a homicidal maniac driven by a fascist, nationalistic ideology of the Baath Party and because he is an Alawite, a sect of Islam that is Shia. His opponents are primarily Sunni hence he gets support from the Iranians and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Oh be quiet.
For a lying-double-talking tweeter?, I thought he would have promoted using, (coal, petroleum fuels, etc.) to build this fence?, OMG??, I just gave him more ideas from which he can take credit for. What a switch-a-roo for him to now promote, "solar" as a way to save$$$ and pay for itself? Another dbl down talk which is becoming his true nature of not delivering on his "campaign promises." You all voted for the wrong guy. One term or less. Putin's puppet on a string, or lap dog, arf,arf.
So says the lady in the clown suit...
Isn't that their job?  What a bunch of LOSERS.
unfortunately the public or should I say liberal voters are as dumb as he is.
You mean an idiot? That he is...And Stein's an idealist, and that's it for third parties that are serious....Though McMullin is gaining headway in Utah....And there's my favourite, Joe Exotic. Who I really don't think is serious at all.  And if Trump is a Democratic plant, then that's going to be one of the most successful things they've done to ensure a presidency..
Mountain View what a supprise.  This is why folks should just live at St Francis and eat at beans.  You can get all the heroin you need from slingin' Sally and Gov Walkers methadone declaration put a 24 hours support group here.  That and you can use the computer to spread pro-democrat links on ADN!  Why would you work, own a house, and drive in MTN VIEW??   Ship Creek fo' life fool!
Slick Willy's chickens have come home to roost, and Hillary needs to be in prison.  Both are pathological liars and crooked as a dogs hind leg.
Yup. Lost to Juneau-Douglas, too. Tight game with J-D. Playing good football against tough competition. Not exactly a case for dirty play. Ketchikan is just a sore loser.
Nonsense, Nonsense, Nonsense...This sounds like a Hillary Clinton campaign speech, I wonder why.
You need to read what you just wrote..because it's a bunch of nonsense. I have seen many videos of arm white people taken into custody and not shot dead.  you must be looking hard not to find videos of unjust killings.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtPt6GrnE6s
OS - why is your filthy mind gravitating to 13 yr olds?
Take a hike Bernstein you're an irrelevant loser.
The officer's concerns, or the concerns of the public who will most certainly demand a full accounting of another homicide.  Anchorage has a lot of roads upon which folks can get to work (Obomba's comment aside).  APD has a responsibility to conduct a thorough investigation, and this one appears more complicated than most.  Your hatred of the police is nonsensical and just plain stupid.
Yes - anyone with a brain does think as sister Joan does! You are just as loathsome as our president-elect!  Blocking option PLEASE??
Say, Bill, what sex was Jesus' dad, God? Was God a male? If so, and Jesus and man are in his likeness, what did God do for sex? Was Jesus a bastard, i.e. Joseph his dad wasn't his dad? That would make Mary a cheater and Joseph a cuckold, right?
Pathetic Liberals. Why are gay Chechen's a top priority for Canada's government? Why do they have to be spirited away in secret? Such utter BS to claim: "it is for their safety". No, it is self-serving of these special interests groups. What value do they add to Canada? These individuals do not represent the value of average Canadian's, or their first priority.  Gays should stop deluding themselves into thinking that the average Canadian really cares about gay rights. They don't. Do they care about heterosexual rights? No, didn't think so. Second, John Ibbistson should not be writing a piece promoting gay refugees over others without disclosing he himself is gay. Full disclosure John. Enough is enough. There are far more needy people out in the world that need Canada's help then homosexuals from a far off country. Take care of your own first, then those in real need, then if you want to save some special interest group, go ahead. But that isn't the Liberal way, it's the Trudeau way.
Have you read the other comments? That kind of hate is OK right? Hypocrite.
Has more to do with the defense against assaults on a very injured, self-loathing ego ... "Perceived status" and "money" are only surrogates for power when someone is as twisted as Trump and his children.    When you have as much money as the Trumps, power is a pernicious drug.  Go to any drug treatment program and you will meet a malicious narcissist similar to Trump sitting on the couch - only most people don't have that much money.  People usually don't crash and burn until they exhaust their finances.    Impeach Trump now, before people start dying ...
Man's death shows idiocy of many National Park visitors: "when they deviated from the boardwalk that hovers safely above ground" That is all.
Trump is the best because the globalist parasites and their lying media is going hysterical. God bless Trump!
Like the Big Island last week. Saw their faces on TV news yesterday. Jest a bunch of dumb Hillbilly mokes who were insulting each other's prides. So laughable. Let 'em go and watch them kill each other off for the cops. Makes are penny a dozen.
Dear Joan Chittister,    I can not fathom how a Catholic  or one who professes to believe in a loving God would EVER  praise  Clinton who heartily believes in sticking a scalpel into a baby's neck just as it is ready to be born...your politics DISGUST me...Clinton also stood by while her husband's mistress of the week performed Fellatio in the revered Whitehouse...not to mention the 30 -40 people the Clintons had mysteriously die or disappear...not to mention how she left our servicemen to die in a foreign land...or how she and her husband have been tied to human trafficking as it is a very prosperous trade...YES,you are ignorant and I am sorry for you...Hell awaits....Virginia Kellenberger
" desist from populist statements which are aimed at character assassination"  Why?  If a man behaves like a crook, why can we not call him out on that?  Is it "character assassination" if it's true?  If the truth is insulting, it is not those who speak it that are at fault.   Dear Minister, if I cheat on my civic responsibility (evade paying taxes) can I also refute the criminal labels as character assassination against me? I didn't think so.  Buddy, you're crook.  Own it.
Hope you're seriously not waiting around for an answer from Chance.  After all, he's wrote comments on this site dozens of times of how he personally stuck it to the union state employees during collective bargaining.  And the hypocrite expects the great state of Alaska to pay for his pathetic healthcare.
Nothing about Democrats ever changes.  This is exactly the type of hatred they directed towards Abraham Lincoln - Democrats said "he was so stupid he did not even know his own first name."  Then a Democrat murdered him.  Sound Familiar?  Nothing ever changes; every Democrat is just another potential John Wilkes Booth (to adapt a phrase from the women's libbers).
He also voted in favor of allowing internet providers to sell our social security numbers, financial information, and passwords to the highest bidder. Any Alaskan that re-elects him is the very definition of stupid.
My husband is Muslim. He thinks burqas are ridiculous.
LOL Waterloo one look at that collection of Libcuck trash explains a lot.
Wow.   People are crazy.
McCain got brainwashed in Vietnam.
Yup my mother at 88 and going strong has NEVER drank bottled water.  Better warn her now before it too late.  What an idiotic remark...has to go down as one of the worst comments ever on this site.
Lindsey Graham Discovers That They're All Bozos On His Bus  Lindsey Goober Graham just assumed that out there, somewhere, some other Republican congress that wasn't packed to the rafters with braying demagogues, racist con men and assorted other complete dolts had been tinkering away for the last seven years on some superawesome Republican health care bill.  And that, when it came time to slap his name on something, he could just rip off their notes, walk it around the Senate and the Sunday shows sounding smart, and then, bing-bang-boom, Lindsay Graham, Health Care Genius is born.
Racist!  Nazi!
Most Canadians do not live in such luxury. Harper never complained ,nor did Chretien. The PM should rent his own house and the RCMP can provide security.  Trudeau is a pampered jerk and spends our money like the Dauphin he is. Sell 24 Sussex to the Chinese- they will buy anything .
I noticed when the Habs were saluting their fans tonight , Price just skated right off the ice. What class the Hab fans are . A bronx cheer to their best player in the past 10 years. Pathetic. Its just a matter of time before he demands a trade.
A real man?  Trump has been a loathsome coward his entire life.  He fabricated a medical condition (that he subsequently could not remember) to avoid going to Vietnam.  He's nothing but a despicable coward.  Who discussed, ever, allowing one million refugees into the United States?  The correct answer is no one.  You just made that up.
Thank God we have a news media that will expose Trump's alternative facts, misinformation and, in this case, distortions of what the mayor of London actually said. In the wake of a deadly terrorist attack, our president decided the best thing to do in support of our ally was revive his personal feud with the mayor of London:  Khan was obviously telling Londoners not to be alarmed about the increased police presence they would see today. Fox News carried it, so I'm sure Trump heard the whole statement. He's simply a pathological liar.
I am a Republican.  You are a complete disgrace to our party.
David Brooks is a dork.  That's a whalers term, btw. But he's also a blowhard worthy of a Melville reference.  Writers for the failing times need a vaca. Oh,oh, oh one more thing. Our present prevailing culture REALLY needs waste laying.  Thank you POTUS Trump. Kneel for justice, but stand for the Flag and the Anthem.
As long as Trump throws gay people under the bus and promises churches they can do whatever they want? No, Utahns don't.
with this old drunk in charge Canada is screwed
BDS and its anti-Israel ilk have only come of age in the past decade (formed in 2005) and not decades, and so has the apartheid slur, none of which has eliminated Israel or Zionism which is the objective.  Bomb threats against Jewish institutions are now the last resort of these scoundrels and their fellow travelers. Scum attracts scum.
Sure they are....if abused or misused, regardless of the object...it's not harmful if used lawfully, and under the conditions SPECIFICALLY designated for its use!  I can put a whole bottle of pills in front of me....not take a single one and suffer no harmful effects from them.  I can also load every firearm I have in the house...and NONE are going to harm anyone...I can leave them like that FOREVER..and no one gets hurt.  That's the point!   It takes some nitwit to misuse, or unlawfully use any "inanimate" object for it to cause harm.  Be it firearm, drugs, hammer, baseball bat, knife, vehicles, etc., they are, by themselves, all alike and harmless. "fer goodness sake"....( Humor is often used as a coping mechanism, especially by those who are forced to deal with the idiocy of people on a daily basis.)
So he was smart, then he was dumb, then he was smart? Sounds dumb to me!
It is silly but not "just" silly... it is also true.  Much like how the word "populist" has been hijacked by the extreme/alt-left, divisive is used -by the MSM- mainly to infer "racism".  The funny thing is that the actual definition of populism ("support for the concerns of ordinary people") is exactly what terrifies the MSM and the hardliners on the Left.
Trumpet's "anything for a buck" environmental program will surely backfire in the long run. Intelligence and common sense will always trump stupidity and greed. Short term investments are risky and seldom profitable. Long term planning is wise and prudent.
Idiot doesn't know the law - the legislature passed the parole eligibility law long ago. Violent crimes are eligible after 50% of the time served minus some earned time and good time. Maybe Weld folks ought to elect someone who knows the law and is not as ignorant as this buffoon.
If you were stupid enough to vote for Trump you deserve the lies, broken promises and "yuge" disappointments coming your way. Bank on it.
Had a little time when not outraged at Fox Shep turning RINO? There are balance pieces on there all the time for multiple writers. But you know that. And by knowing that you are attempting to insinuate and mislead anyone that might wonder if there were truth that ADN was nothing more than a libtard rag. Or is it provide a little self congratulatory prop for conservatives to nod all seriously and knowing like to each other. Free speech? Bwa ha ha! Cuz, you know, set your sarcasm aside and the only thing that's left is another POS whiny conservative snowflake that likes to think he's being muzzled and never, ever, super, very very much gets say what he wants of thinks. Or so he's heard. Cuz truthiness matters. Alt-facts optional. And voters are idiots.  *Zieg Heil to the President....kill all the fgs who don't agree* Hat tip to Green Day. Hope they have a new one for trump.
Actually,  the homeless and addicted do a pretty good job of policing up the "Snipes" in their areas. Absolutely disgusting!
.... and appreciated by their partners. What a ridiculous headline!
Totally agree. Big oil is destroying Canada & U.S. & greedy fools don't care as long as they make $$$ from it. Bunch of retarded idiots.
And you are retarded.
Just pay the dumb thing out.  If it was a complete payout, 61 billion for 640,000 eligible residents, it would be $95,000 per person.  Lets give them 33% of whats there to keep as an emergency fund, that is 20 billion dollars.  That would give every eligible Alaskan $62,700.  Those who are smart with their finances would pay off debts, buy new homes or spend it wisely giving a massive boost to the local economy. Those who are leaches will leave as there is no more fund.  Those who are dumb with their money, well, too bad.  Its your choice.  As for my family i would have a paid off house which would give me $9240 a year in extra income plus a massive emergency fund.  Heck, i may even splurge on a new car.
Does anyone doubt that Colorado's own weasely Cory Gardner will do his master's (Mitch McConnell's) bidding?  The TV ads urging the weasel to think of his constituents are sadly laughable.
Only a deranged liberal would accuse those defending the Truth as whiners. We Faithful Catholics are sick you, Francis, the faggots in clergy and every other liberal disease infecting the Church. We will hold our anger for only so long then we will get beautifully violent and purify the Church.  Effeminate and gay priests beaten and dragged from the pulpit, their protectors in the hierarchy hunted down.. It will be magnificent
If I had made a political statement or protested how police handle blacks while I was being paid for my job, I'd have been fired. Protest on your own time. Besides, they have totally lost the original meaning of the first kneeling and now KIDS are doing it. Some role models these clowns are.  They are over-paid anyway - why do we pay them hundreds of thousands while paying teachers, cops and firefighters fractions of that - and people who risk their lives every day at work can't protest and make a fraction of what these protesting jerks make for working part of a year. (playing a GAME, not saving lives) Americans created these idiots - now live with 'em.
The pope said that whoever denies that humans are contributing to the warming of the planet "needs to go visit the scientists and ask them."   Exactly right.  the Pope speaks truth the republicans are either too greedy or too ignorant to speak.
Flynn is a traitor.  He would sell out his mother for money
jimetjules - YOUR COMMENT IS NOT AT ALL SENSIBLE, EXTREMELY DUMB, MORE THAN INSULTING, AND SHOULD BE REMOVED ASAP TO SAVE YOU FROM APPEARING ANY MORE STUPID THAN YOU MUST BE !!!
Hey BARRY HERTZ, read your review/editorial on the movie Filth City. You are an idiot.  First off, you use the word "pedestrian" which automatically indicates your douche bagery.  You write for the sake of your ears hearing your own words as you recite them. You are a low life, smug, condescending, no talent, wannabe, Z list reviewer and coward.  I have no affiliation with this film what-so-ever, but can't wait to watch it on Netflix. I am sure it will get millions of views.  In closing, some advice. Perhaps you should get better at your job.   V.V.
I'm confused by what you wrote.  Perhaps you would clarify.   You state: "we white practitioners are totally baffled by how we change the meta dynamics of family structure in Native communities."  Then, you go on to talk about the high level of child sexual abuse in those communities and the increasing rate of teenage suicide. Are you suggesting that white practitioners are changing the dynamics of family structure in such a way that abuse is increased?  Or are the two coincidental?  Or is it that you are baffled that you are unable to change the dynamics?   I'm sorry that my question may be stupid, but I'm really unclear about what you wrote.
The problem with Islam is that it's false religion. Allah is Lucifer.
Fear?whatever. You liberals fear the truth and thats why you hate fox. Not to mention the hotties are waaaaayyyy better looking than the typical left wing nasty hag.
Got any proof to back up your nonsense allegations, such as say when they were charged for insider trading. Your Harper infatuation is pathetic.
Nothing short of death would be appropriate for these disgusting thieves.
Many vets also fought communism. Antifa waves their commie flag in the faces of all americans. They are terrorists.
If the democrats see this poll result you can bet they would try to cut Social Security. The stupid RINO's might also agree.
"White nationalists want an all white country"  And they aren't going to get it, this country has never been all white, and never will be, the whole concept is stupid, but, whatever.
Jay whatever is a dick - he should stay in the US instead of coming back a failure with his tail between his legs - the other guy is just another ron mclean playing the straight man to the dick sitting next to him - both are complete morons and not welcome back
There must be something more constructive to do with your time.  This includes the person who wrote this article, pathetic.
Please explain it to me---the Dispatch allows a place for people to comment on issues  . They welcome the comments . So , why is a conservative you disagree with a troll , yet liberals you agree with , not ?  Kathleen Kearon cares enough about issues to take her time to comment . That should be admired .   Should I call the same liberals who follow me all over the Dispatch and attack every position I take--trolls ?  I don't , and shouldn't . Neither should you.
i just luv all these comments coming from a town full of garbage. look around at all the properties stacked high with pallets, bald tires, rotten plywood and whatever other junk they can find . its pathetic.
OH RIGHT, Trump started the trash talk.  AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH            Wrong, Trump started draining the swamp and the swamp is fighting back.
You're a stone-cold cretin.
Lock him up. He's a traitor and the most dangerous PM in history.
It is Canada's national shame. What bugs me is how many smug Canadians run around thinking we are so compassionate and caring a nation.  That's crap...what we are is an attention seeking nation...refugees , Paris accord, blowing hot air at the UN.  These do gooders led by the idiot pseudo socialist , the greatest attention seeker of all, are a bunch of fakes. Oh ya...climate change blah blah, but meanwhile don't care about our grandmothers, and fathers etc. it's not trending at the moment, thank you very much.  What the article doesn't get right is the tens of thousands who don't even bother trying to get into LTC even though they need it  since they know it's futile until u are horribly in need, often living in your own excrement...literally.  Then u get bumped up to priority one...and other warped gate keeping  protocols designed to keep the system from actually responding to the real needs of our elderly.
A typical and stupid overreaction.
Just shut up!  You are a complete idiot.
stupid emoji - Again! North Korea has way more to fear from us and the level of this threat has been manufactured and escalated by tRump - the bully.  In fact, Kim had some rather accurate and cogent and very sad observations of your man, tRump - the illegitimate, Russian installed President. Not my president.
Let him shoot down our pilots so we know what Kim will do?  Dumb!
Obama  and his useless  wife both lobbied hard. At the expense of taxpayers as well which is the disgusting part. He should just live life and enjoy that golden pension that he doesn't deserve. Politicians are the most useless bunch of waste, next to lawyers. What do ya know he is both.
Stupid banks for storing all that money!!!  Its the banks fault they got robbed!  If the bank didn't store all that $$$ then criminals wouldn't target the bank!
Yeah, those damn kids!! Tell those kindergadeners with poor parents to get a damn job!   I'm very thankful that I have a level of understanding, empathy and caring for fellow human beings that you will never have.
Underage?  Get every one of their worthless parents to pay for and help remodel that home beyond the condition it was in prior to the party.  Absolutely disgusting, disrespectful behavior in our culture.
Greedy, dishonest, arrogant.
Yeah its a shame that they actually invested in the region just like the conturds did in Huntsville eh. How much was that again for clement? Oh right 50 million plus that stupid pool they built. Conservatives have attention span deficit disorder. ASDD!!
At this stage in the Trump presidency, there is nothing more pitiful than someone with the handle "rationalis" attempting to make excuses for the most vile, corrupt man to ever occupy the office! Go get some help!
Lagarde referred a dispute to an arbitration panel for a decision on settlement. The court says this is OK. The arbitration panel made a decision of the settlement, and it was done. The court says this is not OK. Found her guilty of negligence.   When you refer to a panel to decide then they decide. And when they decide you don't overrule. The stupid one is the court.
Idiot:  "When I write about people struggling with addictions or homelessness, liberals exude sympathy while conservatives respond with snarling hostility to losers who make “bad choices.”  Right!  "Conservatives" like St Vincent de Paul, the Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, the Eugene Mission, et al?
This is a article from this news wire I subscribe to. Just google the periodical and you will see it. No joke- what is a joke is the usa media that pick up each others stories with no quoted source. Under Carter we stated this one government crap to China in a Oboma type friendship bond. Its not protacall. Just incoming president has had no reason to do it in the past. Now we now why.  PS This realism proxy war is playing out in the UN. If you read the ADN/Post story they say "likely" time after time and quote outgoing bureaucrats. These are the guys leaving the swamp.
Putin is a very sophisticated apparatchik dictator, no fool .... As for Trump - an embarrassment no matter the criteria !
What an ignorant comment.
Why does someone so bereft of any cohesive logic except the cocked hat of constant sordid reference to race, play at being and having cogent intelligent thoughts?  Useful Idiots often think they think for themselves.
The Republic party and Lapierre plus gun manufacturers are amoral thugs.
Some women are the worst!
I'm come across sore losers too.  And I get to do it for the next 4 years, at least!
And even those are losers.
Low life loser!
what a hypocrite - junior is taxing us to death because he feels like it but meanwhile he flies on jets and heli's for 10 vacations just in one year - but hey, he doesn't leave a carbon footprint and so who really cares as he will just carbon tax us.  What a selfish pathetic and corrupt boy - he is not PM calibre in anyone's eyes, not even his mothers.  and certainly not carbon paying tax payers who don't get a free vacation from someone who wants more of our tax dollars so he can look good (or steal) at our expense.  We are all fools for allowing the monies to be given to this foundation.  Further payment must cease. The ethics commissions is now on the hot seat and will get lynched if she finds this all on the up and up.  A fool could do better.
Other idiots in the pokemon world that made the news recently:  -A teen in  N. C. shot and killed while trespassing on private property. -Two Canadian teens wandered across the U. S. border into Montana. -Driver slams into parked cop car in Baltimore. -Driver slams into tree in New York. -Teen hit while crossing a highway in Pennsylvania.
You are confused the incompetent narcissistic Buffoon was leaving office
Sure. I guess Trump forced this fool to act like a criminal. He looks like a homeless guy that needs a job. If it was my kid, regardless of political position, I would give him a crack upside his head. I guess I'm just a big old square.
That's about the most ignorant thing I've read today.
Wow, how can you be so wrong.  A) this is NOT a very conservative state.  There are twice as many of us independents than the combined sum of GOP and Democrats. B) Because of the GOP's closed caucuses you consistently put to the voters the most alt-right radical version of the GOP here in Alaska.  Open up your caucus and you will see more moderate GOP folks in Juneau. C) this State ranks only behind Mississippi as a welfare state.  We get back from the lower 48 states about 4 federal dollars for each 1 dollar we pay into the treasury.  We get welfare from donor states that you hate like CA or NY who pay much more into the treasury than they get out. So much for your BS. D) lastly, the GOP coined the words tax and spend to hide their spending on wars.  The GOP administrations have done more damage to the national debt than all the Democratic administrations combined.  Ya gotta stop sole sourcing info with Fox and the Rushbo.  Being a hypocrite parrot ain't working for you.
Everybody rages against WORDS from Eastman, but not one outrage over a elected representative who SLAPS/ATTACKS a reporter and voter doing his job. Stupid theatrics from legislatures for show. Both Eastman and Wilson need to go. Now! They are stupid bullies thinking they are special because they got elected. Uneducated and uncaring of needs of all Alaskan's just little morons drunk on power.
Looks like the U.N. is as useless as ever.
You are such a HUGE asshole, no ifs ands or butts
But it WAS you, you murderer.
Why is he still here in America?  Thought he was going back to his motherland?  Typical progressive.........just another deceitful, lying hypocrite.
Republicans are discovering how difficult governing is after years of just saying "no."  The majority of them have been repeatedly voting to repeal obamacare like zombies without brains.  Their only coherent argument for repealing the health care law seemed to be that it was because they said they would for the past seven years.  Beyond that, they had no plan and still don't.  To make matters worse, their ignorant leader in the white house also didn't know anything about policy and the legislative process.  Sad!!!
The idiot with the camera and the moronic screaming should have been arrested for interference. What an ass-hat.  This is what Kitty Piercy's Eugene now looks like.  Vote for Skov if you like it; Semple is the voice of reason and change.
Progressive troll  vs  Chickenhawk troll? Are you afraid to ask NK to give up it's nuclear weapons? It's offered to do so.
Probably the most pathetic "defense" I've ever seen. I hope I never have an attorney like that represent me for anything.
A glimpse into the mind of a madman.
Same way Trump did.  The ignorant, the gullible and the naive can and do vote.
I doubt the liberals want to change leadership for a month or so, until the dust has settled alittle. But there is no doubt that animosity towards clark was a major reason for liberals losing seats. Including cabinet minister seats. She'll be gone soon - it's doubtful a Green party would want to deal with her personally, even if they are dumb enough to deal with her party.
This "Trump is the root of all evil" nonsense has become tiresome and so are journalists who appear peeved because the unwashed masses did not follow their advice and vote for Clinton!
You fucking coward, if you weren't you would have a name, you obviously know nothing of who I am , nor what a dog team of domination looks like , you are like so many others--- jelious . Wishing your sorry ass life was more, but I don't have to say shit , you already did . Hey losser , try this --get a fucking life and stay out of mine, which you know nothing about . A real person would say that to my face , ,,, only once !!!
I served.  35th Wild Weasels.  And what Trump (and many other politicians) do with our troops is disrespectful and pathetic.  What makes it worse with Trump is he's a draft dodger like Clinton was...even worse.
What the parish bullies and gossips who "use religion as a weapon against others" don't realize is that they're putting their immortal souls in serious peril with their their cruelty, arrogance, and judgmental disposition towards people they regard as "inferior" and want kicked out of the church.   I remember reading in C.S. Lewis' "Mere Christianity" a passage stating that a cold, self-righteous prig with a superior attitude is far closer to hell than a prostitute; this same thing holds true today.  An arrogant, gossipy parish bully who plays God is far closer to Hell than any LGBT individual.
why are you such an ignorant lefty, see loser when you CUT income taxes governments make net  MORE revenue, its happened every time its been done cause the economy GROWS!.. three examples from history, Reagan cuts meant more revenue, Mike harris in ontario and even JFK in the 60's!
You wish trumps a fool.
Yep sorry for my improper spelling lmao. Another dummy I wouldn't help. A spelling loser with no argument.
Stupid is what stupid does!  When you have a choice?
Why would anyone blame the two most despotic leaders in the world - Putin and Assad? They are both murdering, lying, corrupt ba$tard$
Geez, when does it end?  The do-gooder idiots are at it again. When I order something to drink at a restaurant I frequently see the waiter or waitress's hand on the top of the glass.  Gross.  First they remove salt and pepper shakers from tables, and now straws are a big deal.  I'll be sure to use one every time from now on.
What a load of garbage.    Do you remember 9/11?  That preceded Afghanistan.  And if you really want to go back in history, Mohammed and his successors attacked the whole Middle East and then Europe.  They started it.  Hopefully, we'll finish it.
Scumbag racist
I'm sorry, but that really has to be one of the most stupid things I've read for a while. Vote for the ANC?! Have you ever lived in a place run by them? You're nuts, or an ANC troll.
Legislatures doing their part to keep young people stupid, and wasting their lives.
Go fuck yourself Carl....
Cellodad>  You one big phony!!!  My students went to Farrington, Waianae, Kahuku, so what''s your beef?  You must be one stuck up your B--t kind of person, huh?????  Jerk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Spicer and Huckabee Sanders both come across at the podium as angry, nasty, bullies.  And that is VERY bizarre, I cannot think of any other press secretary in recent decades so pungent and elbows-up.  Trump may have trouble finding a replacement - indeed the simplest fit, to carry that described torch, is to provide his own press briefings...
You cant argue with stupidity........what is their reaction to no Keystone XL.  If anything the AMericans are going to build a pipeline to export oil up here.....there sweet light crude.  not the disguistging stuff coming out of our tarsands
How many times does SCOTUS have to smack this idiot down for him to get the picture?? I mean seriously....what a moron.
Shut up, a hole.
Re: "Trump says terror acts in Europe were ignored by ‘dishonest press.’ Evidence says otherwise"  That's because he is a full-on deranged, unhinged, uninformed, egomaniacal lunatic.  "Sad!"
Hussein wouldn't even do this and he had the most transparent administration in the history of forever.  If by transparent I mean corrupt and dishonest.
Trudeau won't look after us, he's to busy being a feminist.
Just stop with the fake news. There was no invasion of Ukraine and you look ridiculous pretending.
At what point will the public understand that this woman is a crook?
isn't it amazing how people can travel thousands of miles risking death to come to America, manage to find jobs to not only support themselves but also send 1/3-1/2 of their paycheck back home to support their family, and yet right here in Eugene Oregon our citizens find it impossible to find work to support themselves. Surely laziness, apathy, and a dead end dead beat lifestyle has nothing to do with that. It's obviously the 1% to blame. What Junior fails to grasp is simply put, let's trade homeless for homeless. Bring in India's homeless for ours. $10,000 says the Indian's find jobs their first day and rise from poverty whereas our social parasites will starve to death in India.
I'm sorry, when did he launch any nukes? Stop making things up, makes you sound foolish.
The Mayor is such a complete fraud. The DPD simply needs to go to work, set up speed and traffic light patrols, and have officers on the road  during rush hour to enforce current laws, as opposed to making their shift changes during rush hour. If the Post requested info on how few traffic tickets are given out in Denver vs. other similar sized cities you'd have your answer. Half the cops don't ever leave the police building and Denver cops rarely enforce traffic laws, registration and insurance requirements, etc. Hancock simply wants to waste public money and not accomplish anything, as he and the DPD refuse to take any responsibility or change police policies. Instead, the con man in charge claims "collecting more data" using some highly paid and hardly working new city employees will keep distracted /ignorant pedestrians and drivers from killing each other.  "The initiative lays out 70 specific actions — like improving data collection — ...."
Our city council is a joke, they let these fools run wild in the city no ankle bracelet or anything. One was seen at the rec center in a hot tub with children, pathetic!
After lots of research I came to the conclusion that one has to be stuped not to use it for the medical benefits. Why wait until you have dementia to use it. Rather use the preventive abilities. Needing to be sick to use it is stupidity. Should be free to be used as you see fit. No other plant has so many health benefits, or is so benign. Why make it illigal?
Very accurate analysis.  trump really is a raving lunatic.  It was embarrassing to watch him snort his way through last night like the pig he is.
Trump is nothing but a monkey throwing poop, and overly emotional and hateful monkey throwing poop. If he keeps this up I'd expect head rotation like in The Exorcist, or spontaneous combustion.  All I've seen this election is a bunch of stardom and fanfare. Its depressing that the American people are so easily manipulated by such histrionic outbursts and subpar accusations.
You are a troll.
A troll talking about intellectual capability?  You're a troll.  That's the extent of your capability.
She sounds like a moron, who never should have been entrusted with caring for young children.
Letters to the Editor  Eugene Weekly  2-9-2012  "It seems the leftstream media, including the R-G editors, are amazingly ignorant of this (R-G, Jan. 23), and they parrot said ignorance to an unquestioning, dumbed down populace — swallowed in toto by the same folks who got bamboozled into voting for a clown from Chicago who has saddled each and every one of us with over $12,000 in new debt in three short years of drunken spending.  As George Boosh always tried to say, “Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice …”  Don Richey, Eugene  EDITOR’S NOTE: According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Bush-era tax cuts and two wars account for more than half our nation’s deficits.

The only thing !malignant is the press and the MSM who are raging in an out of control tantrum over their loss of influence.  They have long thought they were royalty, with special rights, but the majority of the citizens now see them for what they are, tools of the Globalist Elite establishment.  We no longer believe ten or accept their belief that we must believe the lies they spout or act according to their mandates.   They have exposed themselves to be the liars and propagandists of he establishment and have destroyed their brand.   They might as well all retire because we will not support their sponsors.
Absolute rubbish. Dr. Stern's potential conflict of interest disclosure is plainly written in the final paper. This is appears to be a dishonourable and almost laughable attempt by the McMaster committee to throw a good doctor under the bus due to political pressure.   Dr. STERN'S DISCLOSURE FROM THE CMAJ PUBLISHED GUIDELINE PAPER: "Competing interests: ...Sol Stern was a member of advisory boards for Astra Zeneca, Bristol-My ers Squibb and Johnson and Johnson; received fees for expert opinions from the Canadian MedicalProtective Association; received consulting fees from mdBriefCase.com, Ethypharm and Sea Courses; and received honoraria for Continuing Medical Education presentations from Purdue Pharma and Paladin...."  Are we to now believe that no-one on this committee read the final drafts before publication and were subsequently not aware of the doctor's  disclosure.? Unbelievable!!
Our president is an incompetent fool...and that's one of his less problematic traits.
You racist swine. However you do score points for equality.
The cons have zero credibility until they actually open up impeachment proceedings.     Occasionally clucking your tongue over his Twitter account or his latest ridiculous outburst in person, or the way he handled (and continues to handle) Charlottesville IS NOT ENOUGH.
Hey! I like buttery yams! I don't like doughy, orange, narcissistic, asinine, lying, disingenuous Trump.
Wolfie, now you are the racist misanthrope!! I am no more an immigrant then you, but I don't know that since your pseudonym implied that you are probably something beside an Indian.  But it wasteful responding to a racist hypocrite like yourself who just rant, raved and belittled anyone who say anything that you oppose. What a nasty little bigot!!!
Stupid to hold these meetings in the heart of important cities. Pick a rural location and designate an appropriate demonstration site where property damage isn't an issue.
klastri was right. You are the laziest person on here. http://trumpgolfcount.com/displayoutings Under the heading "Golfing?" all those "Yes" answers are links to evidence (photos) of him golfing. Can you be any more obtuse?
So explain those who peacefully wanted to counter the protest with a flame thrower, baseball bats, and violence attacking those who they disagree with?  They are the same, vile and disgusting.
The Christian terrorism fueled by the nationwide televangelist tax scofflaws continues. More threat from priests and preachers in their churches than any transgendered individual relieving him/her self. Disgusting.
I am standing by for the false outrage from the hypocritical posters with iPhones...
Another lowlife bites the dust. Good riddance to bad rubbish. Now he can't endanger anyone else on the roads with his selfish behavior. I wish death upon all those that exhibit this type of behavior, as I have zero tolerance for people who endanger innocents for their own selfish thrills.
I am not supporting Zille's thoughtless remarks, but to me the author's analogy with her tweets to colonialism that "today’s Jews benefited from scientific advances made during the Holocaust" is unsustainably idiotic.
What are the charges?  A crime on U.S. soil? or does the U.S. continuing to act as police agency for the world paid by the U.S. taxpayers?  The same idiocy resulted in the Iraq invasion while Saudi Arabia, the home and source of funding for the 9/11 terrorists, escaped any penalty.  The worldwide unleashing of the CIA and the entire Security Apparatus to fund and fill foreign prisons with individuals kidnapped from their homelands without any legal justification other than "we can".  The illegal, corrupt, anti-human terrorist policies devoid of any intelligence and/or common sense driven by military might without concern for human rights.  Time for a Revolution.
GO to hell if you are going to attack our houses/lands and home and lobby for China.
Boo hoo hoo.  Apparently someone doesn't like the truth.  Might want to put on some glasses to see better.  We do have some ignorant ones in this country.
Trudeau has nothing going for him except celebrity. No experience. No brains. No common sense. If O'Leary is the best option to toss this underachieving deficit lover out of office, he has my vote.
muslims have been  told to prolificate - justin is a complete fool.
It's so gross to call that liar "uncle" anything.  I'm glad I'm young enough to not believe that guy was the second coming. He was corrupt and his actions went a long way to sink our state down the tubes of corruption and cronyism. And he enabled Bill Allen's behavior. Gross, gross, gross.
Trash. Food is horrible. Service is bad. And the Bible thumping people who say it's great are sheep. No shock as they voted for Trump.
And your responses are "consistently asinine" as well as completely dense.    Have anything to add that is on topic and involves that?  For example, I have NEVER liked Flake, Corker or McCain as (supposed) Republicans. They are part of the swamp. There is many more to go too.  There, my comment.  Your turn!
McCain, receiving healthcare available to government employees as a US senator for his brain cancer, returns to vote for proceeding to debate stripping healthcare from millions of citizens. What a disgusting hypocrite! But still not as disgusting as the republican senators exempting themselves from the impact of the healthcare bill they wish to impose on everyone else!
"This is a human decency issue."  It sure is, so please explain to me why Casinos are up and running while large parts of the Island are without electricity or running water? That's certainly not appropriate for Women, children and elderly who are starving and suffering, now is it? Priorities are all out of whack, even after the Island has been destroyed. It's ridiculous, as well as unbelievable.
LIfe has become so cheap in Alaska that we should have a death penalty not only to deter murder but also to extirpate these worthless scumbags from our society.
But the malignant narcissist, mentally deranged sociopath and bigot/racist will stand with Texas "as long as needed."
This is absolutely the most idiotic post I have ever read on all levels. What part of the term "global climate change" is confusing you?
The dumb become dumber. The few ruin it for the many. You protestors helping your children or others children to get further behind in education. You live on a little blue ball and all you know about the outside world is from cartoons or some space series.
Obama's true nature is coming out. A small, petty and incompetent leader who confuses big talk with action. Now that he has all the political donations squared away and after 7 plus years of doing nothing he is trying to salvage some kind of legacy.
Obamacare is a disaster whose full dimensions are now becoming apparent.  Should we let the disaster get worse and worse with each passing year, or should we blow it up before it can do further damage?  This editorial is another in a long line of leftwing nonsense.  Read Shapiro's column today for another example of it.  The people of America elected Trump to drain the swamp.  It's no surprise that the swamp-creatures, including this newspaper's editors, are squealing.
Eastman is one of those creepy guys who can't stop focusing on female reproductive areas. It is not PC for him to hang w preteens and advise them on no birth control, maintaining virginity, etc. So he grasps at some non factual female reproductive stuff. Think about it, female mutilation and abortion vacations?   Eastman will not go near my girls. I'll scream, spit and kick his creepy body away from them and me.   The dude is sick.
Kaneshiro is lazy if not incompetent.  He won't do anything other than CYA.
Trump is a weak man's idea of a strong man, a poor man's idea of a rich man, and a stupid man's idea of a smart man.
If they only had a brain......
Sorry, this may be banned, but your comment is Stupid!
I'd happily boot your rear end out of Canada.  If you don't support the country, get out.  You're not wanted here.
Yes she has demonstrated conflict of interest and there is plenty of proof. But regardless, as far as libel goes - did Rob Ford get sued for calling Justin Trudeau an f----ing  faggot? The comment was broadcasted but there was no backlash or threat of lawsuit that I am aware of.  Not that I know anything about Eastern Canada.
Seattle is thriving. Seattle property values are soaring. Anchorage is declining. You can't fix stupid.
Anthony "The Ant" Weiner and most probably Waldo Clinton's chance at POTUS taken down by a white trash gal from North Carolina.  Ha Ha Ha Ha!  It doesn't get any better than that folks.  Time to revisit Waldo's use of a private server and forwarding e-mails to a very unprotected laptop shared by The Ant and his lovely Muslim Brotherhood wife Huma.  Lock 'em all up!
Your's is the most ridiculous and pathetic post I've seen here on DP's site in a while. Borders on idiotic.
I so laugh at Dems who say the GOP is breaking apart.  Any student of history can see...easily...that in 20 years at most there will be NO DNC. These are selfish, insolent children.  This is the party of Kamalla Harris...who slept ehr way to the top and is now nothing but a semi attractive chick with zero understanding of the REAL America...and not FDR or JFK. It is the Harvey Weinstein sex club, led by Bill Clinton and his cuckold wife....even Obama...the fool who starts trouble and then ALWAYS ends up partying with the elite of Hollywood... is going to be detested in 5 years by his own party when they see the damage he did to it. It is now a new America...the freaks are losing and we will soon be rid of their nonsense.
Eat shit you stupid fuk.
Damn cousin you never changed!! Meth ruins lives!! Always was outa control
Because then you have to pay for shipping, possibly twice; You're an adult, act like it; Family members might not do that because it's borderline stupid and certainly a waste of their time.
Lamborn is hopelessly dirty and dumb! "I would hope that Congressman Lamborn would see the value of enforcing clean water laws.” instead of giving away the health and welfare of his constituents. It’s not just the EPA, but it’s also the state of Colorado that filed the lawsuit.  The EPA doesn’t go around suing willy-nilly.
Get a grip loser #TrumpDerangementSyndrome  You feeble minded lemmings disgust me
You have deviated widely from reality once more, GBA. Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease is what you mean; humans aren't "cows". "Trum" is of course a reference to anal hair, and "trumphobia" would be fear of trum as a subcultural shortcoming.  You really have your head in the toilet, pal.
The buffoonest buffoon of all time.
No but the fools on the charter commission approved putting it on the ballot and enough fools voted in favor of it so welcome to the future.
Mr. Ritz is a rude and uncouth man. He won't be missed.
Trmplethinskin is a narcissistic sociopath with visions of dictatorship dancing though his orange locks.
You cannot just drive truckloads of aid to an island. But stupid is as stupid does and this pair is really stupid.
What a load of absolute rubbish (sic). If this idiot's mates in the trough-snouting ANC hadn't stolen all the money for providing jobs, we wouldn't have any bin pickers! These people make an almighty mess of my bin and recycle bags every damn week and are a curse. Really, this fool needs to wake up.
You're pathetic Roy.  A little man hiding behind a computer screen.
Another prime example of the fact that you can't fix stupid!  Pray tell, was DumS--t and the gun doing the waltz, rhumba, foxtrot or quickstep??  Pray that the victim recovers.  Given that the shot punctured her heart, God clearly has something left for her to do here.
who cares how stupid you are lefty, Trump is going to be president, hence the office deserves respect from us given its our largest customer
typical REPUBLICAN crooks is what i call em
"The government is hoping to legalize pot by July 1, 2018"  It is utterly stupid (or corrupt or both) to delay it like that.  It just deepens and worsens the tangle around partial enforcement that we already have.  I trust that the courts won't convict anyone who they know would be constitutionally absolved just a few months down the road, but police and local authorities might still make trouble for people.
Because the the fool that is succeeding Obama won't heed or even attend intelligence briefings and is too worried about his business interest with Putin to take concrete action.
You're speaking about your presidential wanna-be, correct? Because it's pretty clear Trump has no respect or love for our country--only for himself. He is a consummate narcissist and a danger to America and the rest of the world.
Oh, c'mon. The establishment media is going to make sure Trump is elected if they keep this biased reporting up. The American voter is not that stupid.
The "Ugly American" reeks it's political fear.  Kim Jong is not stupid.
What is the reason they have a lack of education are illiterate and murdering innocents? What set them up to create mayhem instead of having sedate lives and living high off the hog from the sale of all that oil and gold buried in their lands? If they are not getting a taste of the good life off the sale of oil and gold, who is profiting off their resources? As a Native, I see the results of colonialism foisted on my people since syphilis infected Columbus, and the slaughter of 100 million Natives in order to christianly steal Native resources and lands and placing the survivors in concentration camps. I see America is no different than the Imperial Roman Empire, invading and occupying other countries so civilized white collar parasites can leech off stolen resources. Maybe our leaders can convince Congress that colonialism is theft and murder, and results in creating terrorists, so our gov't will stop, and we can deal with the existing terrorists, without creating new terrorists.
Did I not quote the unscripted PM Gomer from the 2013 Mansbridge transcipts in the context of the Boston Marathon bombings?   Further, on those poor misunderstood Boston Marathon terrorists: "During questioning, Dzhokhar alleged that he and his brother were motivated by extremist Islamist beliefs."  So yes, there is at least one Canadian fool who sees "terrorists, of the Islamic or far right variety (extremists of any kind), as poor and misunderstood." So Thomas, are you also part of that group of fools?
The question and answer are both useless without context. What is your current tax bracket? What is your expected future highest tax bracket? What is your expected tax bracket upon retirement? Do you already own a home, or are you saving up for a down payment on a home, or have you taken a pledge of lifetime non-home-ownership?  From the point of view of having a saving discipline, I would prefer a TFSA.  "I like the deduction for the RSP contribution because I get a nice tax refund." I am not impressed that you need to be bribed and are oly thining short-term.
Keep it up moron! The more you turn Republicans against you, the sooner we rid this country of your lunacy!!
We owed Omar nothing.  SCC did not order an apology or a huge pay off; the people of Canada have been embezzled by PM JT & his clowns.
your post is not fair,, its pathetic and stupid
something tells me the liberals out here are going to as usual show how ignorant they are about conservatives, since it is the left that lives by hate
another insanely stupid article.
Do you think any of those idiots vote?  Really? Their language, as everyone clearly heard, was more like what has been recorded at Trump rallies.  You asked for it, you got it.
Bob Corker is a degenerate pervert that somehow got elected 2 US Senate. First he shud go phuchimself then hang self!
Kind of like a 69 year old racist hag who lies, cheats, and steals her way through the law field and politics for financial gain, and her reward is to have no criminal charges filed against her.
Kind of ridiculous the public is subsidizing a corporation that charges more to be a member than other local gyms.
He is a piece of garbage like most of the FCPD. Glad hes back after tossing around a girl who doesn't weight 100 lbs.i bet you love Trump
Right, a nasty little Troll.
williams is an idiot and a coward. If he cared in the least, he would push a phase-in of e-verify with stiff penalties.  He is just as worthless as the rest of CONgress and the GOP.
Life is hard.  It's harder when you're stupid.  Now taxpayers have to pay to patch up this doofus.
You go Lisa Raitt! I'm not a conservative but I like you! Kick that arrogant jerk to the curb.
Nice try, to defend the indefensible.    Sure, people so want to feel Justin's presence they would gladly pay thousands of dollars without wanting anything in return.  If Harper did the same, you would call for blood on street.  What a hypocrite.
Bill Walker is a modern version of Capt. W.H.Logan, who salvaged the shipwrecked Princess May in 1910.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_May_(steamship)  Although I easily could have, I have NEVER applied for a PFD-check.  FREE money for living in Alaska has a psychological down-side. I wonder how much PFD-$$$ goes to buying illegal stupid stuff ?? AK seems to have a terrible problem with drug abuse and alcohol and tobacco.  If it was 1980-82 again and I was a leader in AK govt;  I'd design the Pfund distribution as a debit-card that can be used for only useful stuff like food, fuel, tools, transpo.  I support Governor Bill Walker's tough choice, he's tugging on a leash around an untrained puppy's neck trying to keep it out of trouble... and the puppy is yelping loudly, chewing on the leash, howling, and urinating all over itself.
Some people are just surviving and some people just want to kick them when they're down. Why? Labeling all homeless with denigration is disgusting. By your story, whoever gave you help when you were homeless should be scolded for extending help.
Why not?...people disagree with you perhaps because you're wrong and you can't handle it which is clearly evident by your ridiculous comment!.....grow up dude!
What. A. Muppett. The sooner we get rid of this clown the better.
I don't recall the ADN calling tRump a fascist. But racist?  I don't know that ADN has labeled him, but he his views on races are well know.  You have no need to defend Donny Dumpster and his garbage.
You are right on the real story.  Hard to understand the blatant ignorance of publicly turning a blind eye to uranium sales, NSA spying on political rivals, secret meetings between AG's and former Presidents, Susan Rice, cash deliveries to Iran, 30,000 deleted e-mails under subpoena, destroyed devices, illegal FISA warrants, illegal "un-masking", and the outrageous act of not indicting a person that clearly violated the Secrets Act by James Comey.  Comparing all this to the "Russian" hacking(whatever that means) is obvious in it's sheer stupidity.
Alive... and in high style. Perhaps you would like to say a word in favor of Judas or Jonathan Pollard? Are you the sort of person that Canada brought over from The Fascist Ukraine. More fool they!
The gun rights extremist like the NRA were not affected by 20 dead children in a classroom, so I doubt any mass shooting like the one this weekend or worse ones in the future will change their minds about assault weapons.  That is the kind of reasoning that makes the NRA ideology and the Republican platform sick leaving the majority of Americans frustrated at such callous ineptitude.
Where's the US Fish and Wildlife service on this issue?  This idiot just killed an ESA-listed species that he had NO RIGHT TO HUNT, since it isn't one of his traditional subsistence menu items. That usually means some jail time and at least 80,000.00 in fines.
It looks like the Keahlohas had a full blown criminal enterprise going. I wish the FBI would take a harder look at the shenanigans over on Kauai. Misappropriation of county funds, a crooked judge and a corrupt Child Protective Services just a few of the issues that need Federal attention and intervention.
Hilliary said Trump was a slime-ball because he would contest the election results. She is pathetic.
He doesn't care about histry or what side of it he's on as he doesn't think there is anything worthwhile in looking at history because he says that's looking backwards and it's a waste of time doing that. The only thing wirth looking at is the furutre - what a imbecile.
Why didn't the Democrats pass gun legislation when they had the chance? Bunch of useless morons. You need guns to protect and defend yourself or else.
Redneck culture? Can't stop judging and labeling groups of people can you? How liberal and tolerant. These punks are thug culture, dirtbag culture, braindead culture. If I need help give me a good ole redneck any day, anything but a judgemental liberal!
Just shut it down idiot
Your view is horribly flawed and self serving. It' a "scientific review board",  not an industry cheerleading panel.  Geez........people like you are a waste of good education.
This dude should have left well enough alone.  I mean, Pete Kerns decided not to go forward with disciplinary action and the next thing you know he's suing the city.  He's lucky he didn't get canned.  Yes, I realize the city decided to suspend him, but I still feel like he's an idiot for pressing the matter.
Trump has been in denial about this hacking issue all along ! - His massive ego will not allow him to say out loud that he was wrong about this ! - Someone else has to say it for him ?? - Pathetic !!! - Trump is dangerous !
Is McCain the dotard ? His state is one of the worst for Obama Care w/ 116% increases.  Perhaps his medical condition is affecting his reasoning .......
and the idiot of the day proves the lib trolling stupidity yet again
I know you think you're being edgy and lashing out at "stupid republicans" but the people these policies hurt most are the citizen minority populations that Dems claim to love and want to help so much and so often.  But then they're happy to sell out our own minority communities to foreign citizens at the drop of a hat when it suits their latest pet agenda.  If I were a minority in this country that has always voted Dem, stuff like this would be a huge wake up call for me, and from what I see online, it is.
This woman is just as arrogant as Justin. No wonder he made her a minister.
There is so much miss-information on this issue that I honestly cannot decide if these guys are complete lunatics or the most heroic, patriotic men since the war of independence.
The insult wasn't directed at the mother.    It was stupid, but anybody who thinks it was directed at the mother must be blind or trying to spin this.
You're still seeing Trump through the glasses the media presented to you, and likely think you're all clever. You're an idiot. I'd suggest you see Trump through different glasses, but I know you can't do it. You will see in the year ahead that Trudeau will take Canada down with his policies instead of lining up with Trump!
Boots>  You really are a "jerk!"  All you do is spout about "fear, fear and more fear."  Isn't it that you're the one who is actually afraid of the muslims?  C'mon own up, you're just a chicken s__t.?  You so scared of the Russians, Chinese, and also the Iranians and N. Koreans, too?  Preach the fear card.  Ha ha ha!  Got your number now.  Have a nice day!
Liberals like Dallaire and Junior  are far beyond simple common sense and are lost in a world of dumbed down stupid  pro terrorist liberalism.
The Globe & Mail anti-Trump bias has infected the investing pages.  Time to cancel my subscription.  I don't need to pay for this trash.
Also, that guy is right. You probably should smoke a little. Everytime i see your name on here you are posting extreme right negative junk. You seem to rage against anything that might possibly bring a human joy in this life. You need something to cheer you up and help you relax. You're gonna have a coronary if you keep this up.
Pres.

To all you DUMB AF RIGHT WING MORONS more butt hurt about "protests" than the DEATHS OF UNARMED AMERICANS, first of all FOK YOU, secondly idiots, the NFL CONTRACTS and MONEY is not dependent on RATINGS YOU ABYSMALLY STUPID PEOPLE. When NBC, CBS, ESPN ETC gives you BILLIONS  ( 20.4 BILLION to be exact) you simply don't NEED RATINGS! The only people you are hurting with your stupid boycott are the people who work at the NETWORKS, the NFL will be just fine. Read it and weep , MORONS.   Until the broadcast contract ended in 2013, the terrestrial television networks CBS ($3.73B), NBC ($3.6B) and Fox ($4.27B) — as well as cable television's ESPN ($8.8B) — paid a combined total of US$20.4 billion to broadcast NFL games.  THE CURRENT CONTRACT IS EVEN BIGGER. RACIST SCUMBAGS!
The Russians didn't hack the world? Tell us something we didn't already know six or seven months ago when the colluding fakestream media started hammering on this sham narrative just before the election.   The only ones who were expecting anything concrete to come of this, are the usual deranged, depraved psychotics who are servile to the corrupted leftist globalists.
A mistake is "stupidity"??? That would make you very,very, ......!
Gee, has he done anything positive, howler? Do enlighten us.  Here's a wild thought - maybe the stories are negative because he's such an incompetent, petty windbag? Why waste your time defending it?
Never thought somebody could make a more foolish Leaf statement than Whazziecalledtoday, but it appears we have a winner!
1. The Bloor line is already crowded. It can't take adding one quarter of the city's transit traffic. 2. Get actual costing, not "ttc-style" guesstimates. Six km overland costs $300M for tracks, for example, not billions. 3. Get actual experts to decide, not city councillors. 4. We can't afford anymore idiotic mistakes. 5. Remember, journalists often get frustrated, but rarely get planning credentials.
I don't disagree with your logic, what scares the hell out of me is the damage this idiot will do between now and then, if for some reason he does last the four years. He has the credibility of our country worldwide in the toilet already, and he hasn't even made it three months yet.
"Trump's best, and only non-military option left at this point, is to "out-crazy the crazy.""  I hate to break the news to you, but Trump's approach is not a strategy. He IS crazy.
Your pathetic false equivalence is breathtaking.  Whatever President Trump's faults are they do not include murdering close relatives with VX nerve gas or anti-aircraft guns, running a totalitarian, racist, fascist state with no free elections, completely controlling all speech, press and assembly, drafting all men and women, running slave labor camps, gratuitously murdering three generations of a person he does not like's family, engaging in: counterfeiting, kidnapping, human trafficking, illegal drug and weapons trade, money laundering, insurance fraud, and terrorism.  You belong in Pyongyang.  It would serve you right.
Only idiots believed collusion anyway. Hey, how about those emails that showed the media colluded with Hillary to defeat Bernie? That is an actual scandal....WHERE ARE YOU ON THAT Chris?
So thats all that matters? That she is a woman? You are a sexual racist.
Says the idiot on perpetual welfare. You are a disgusting human.
my god another loser with no respect for 200K tax payer dollars wasted,,
idiot with a voice
She was an unfaithful sleeze. She made a vow and did not keep it. She couldn't keep her legs shut. She completely destroyed her hard working man because of her sexual addiction and welcomed a man other than her husband into her bed. Of course he lost it. He goes to work while she shares there marriage bed with a low life scumbag. Those kids belong with his family not hers. Who knows how sleazy that sister is. She is probably after the PFDs and probably is just as sleazy.
Drumpf supporters are the kakocracy. They are the bacterial infection in the body politic, and Drumpf is the diarrhea.
For the pathetically small number who voted anyhow.
mtf1953>  BOY, YOU SURE ARE SOMETHING.  I GUESS YOUR MOMMY HAD TO F**T YOU OUT SINCE YOU'RE SUCH A BIG PILE OF BS!  You really need to get a grip of your immature emotions, because you sure show your true colors to everyone.  I'll bet you don't have any friends, wife or girlfriend, and hopefully you don't have any kids.  But by chance if,  you do have all or some of the preceding, I would pity them for having to be around  someone like you that is so full of hate.  Honestly, aren't you a racist and a neo-nazi yourself?  Since you claim to be "intelligent" what makes you think "intelligently" that I am a racist and a neo-nazi, come on Mr. Intelligent prove your accusations or forever shut your dirty trap????  What verifiable proof do you have, you got nothing right, so shut tour filthy trap!!!  For you the saying goes "Talk is cheap, but Action is nowhere to speak."  How many posters agree with the crap you put out, huh????  Name them????  Cam't you be a NICE person????
I thought Oxfam was suppose to help the less fortunate. Instead they are advocating for some kind of collective government. They should advocate for freedom and democracy which always produces the best results for the majority of people. Maybe they should educate themselves instead of writting foolish reports.
You AND RLH? Bonus stupidity.
I'm a CONSERVATIVE woman and let me clue you into one fact, most men ARE jerks. Alt left women are equally loathesome.
"But they can probably afford Smart Phones, Cable TV and Dutch Brothers coffee? " When I was in elementary school, I could barely scrape together enough change to buy a candy bar. Are you saying that these kids are splurging on Dutch Bros??? Extravagant little bustards!
DickSince89; Sorry but I was educated in public school before they started brainwashing the kids like they are today. I proves that I must be stupid as you and I do not agree. It must be hard living among dolts like me with your superior mind.  I guess that to save the planet I should join up with the smart folks like you and Eric.
Putin is a murderous oligarch.  Does that mean that his grand children must be judged by that one day?
Alaska dispatch news keeps charging me 9.99 a month. I did not ask for this. They said .99 a month.  And won't refund me.   Fucking thiefs
I don't know.  Folks in Nevada are pretty stupid and ignorant, from what I have experienced with them.  Their school system has been a wreck for decades, just like Oregon's.   Plus they have a very transient population, with a lot of Casino workers.    Much of the population is very low class.    Tobacco, alcohol, and drug use are all very high.  Jurors should be far less sophisticated and intelligent, compared to a jury from Portland.  Let's hope that the Federal Prosecutors in Las Vegas do indeed do a better job.
The jackasses at Anchorage Daily News have cooked up a new censorship scheme for their comments sections...you now have to rate other people's comments as 'civil' or 'not civil.' The idea is that they won't have to waste their time censoring you, they'll get everyone else to do it for them. For you to post, you have to rate other people's comments. For your post to get through, they have to rate yours.  HOW FUCKING NAZI IS THIS?!!  They're too lazy to censor you themselves. But they have to make sure YOU get censored, so they dump that job on other commenters.  FUCK YOU ADN.
It was a human male not a female fat sac.
You had me until you got to Seneca 'ashamed'.    A private business has no duty to save a politician or a group of them from their own stupidity.  And if Seneca risked its capital to build the magic electricity producing burner and they hired better experts than the politicians, that's just what happens sometimes when governments start trying to act like businesses without having the knowledge or the expertise.   We have seen Portland and the State of Oregon try numerous times try to make computer decisions like a business and blow millions and most recently hundreds of millions of dollars because of gross ignorance.     This is just another of those situations.
It's those darn radicalized Presbyterians!
I love how he is targeting the illegals.  Other than that, not much.  He's a lousy speaker, the tweeting is annoying, and I really resent his bringing is family into his administration.  VERY unprofessional.  His sons are pure scum.  P.S. I voted for him - no regrets about that.
You have to be joking or just plain stupid. Just when did the Russians decide that Trump would be their candidate, Maybe at birth or maybe when he got out of college, or when he became the main Republican candidate. I suppose he would win your approval if he had become a community organizer. You make me laugh.
But what's important is we throw these hijacking manipulative selfish bums in parliament out. Decreasing immigration and a new immigration mix is in order, very obvious, only issue to vote on, nothing else matters.
Please stop feeding the bottom trolls.
They read it! Even the devil knows the words. Satan uses these idjits. Politicians and false teachers just decided to make it better by changing and using it to suit the agenda as despots and tyrants. Depending on  blind stupid people to believe their words instead of searching for truth. Any who has read for themselves, studied and believed could never ever do what preachers and politicians have done or  follow said false prophets party line bs.
The Japs are the real killers of Whales in the Southern Oceans and Dolphins in Taiji Bay-Disgusting race!!
Hilarious and stupid...and this guy is a Yale Divinity Professor?
he was predictably bad years ago...his attention span is about 5 minutes...his bombastic comments at point A will be denied totally at points B and C.. It is really humorous, yet pathetic.
As I like to say .........There is corrupt and competent............and then there is corrupt and incompetent.    I'll stick with the Liberals.
Several old hens have obviously crossed the border and opining in reaction to political stories
The parks are great. I have money to go to them.  All the minorities and poor folk can just watch the internet!  Outdoor rich folk entertainment centers are fun!  Wow! Protect the animals while the bulk of the children on the planet starve!  How bout some caribou stakes for Brazil? Oh, you libs with your convoluted, sick, demented hypocrisy!
Not much mystery why our delegation is backing Trump.  If they didn't, they'd have to back Clinton ... a liar and a crook.  Give the book "Clinton Cash" a fair reading, and then tell me you could vote for Hillary.
Among many other things I guess you are forgetting where Trump would not say that if he lost, he would respect the results. Setting the stage for a possible civil war. And she was pathetic for calling him out? I think not.
Keep trying to sell it,  just like the Federal election where Harper was the devil, and now look at the fool we have at the helm.
Who said he was innocent, cretin?
You're mentally delayed.
Idiot
No. Ritz is simply a jerk.
You really ought to get your head out of your butt and check out that fresh air. Obama was the most anti-cop president of the last 50 years. And his attorney general, Eric "Let's not prosecute the black panthers" Holder, didn't help matters. Only a partisan hack (or an idiot) says Obama has zero culpability here.
Yes she mentioned white people as whites were the people who voted for him.  What other racial group voted for him?  I am not aware of any sizable minority that voted for him.  Maybe Russians?  The fact is the people who voted for him were not intelligent.  They were influenced by imaginary fears created by the Donald such as Mexicans are swarming over the border to take your job. or Muslims are going to rape your women.  Pathetic.
stop lobbying lies - there are currently over 500 oil spills/leaks in Alberta at this moment and fort mac is burnt to a crisp, that fire has continued and is still burning IN DECEMBER all the way to Saskatchewan.  it's not "leftist" you freaken moron, it's a national security risk.
The Trump phenomenon just illustrates, to me, how easy the electorate is to dupe. Their support of Trump shows how short sighted they are, how susceptible to propaganda they are and how lazy they are. It takes a little time,  but the truth isn't so hard to get to. The genius of the Republican party is accusing the other guy of doing what they are in reality doing and deflecting blame every where but where it belongs. In general, it is the Republican party and it's rich patrons, the Oligarchy, that is to blame for the countries woes. However, it is an ignorant and naive electorate that shares the blame for electing these errand boys to run our affairs and for not getting past their visceral responses to dog whistle politics. The Republican party wins votes through fear, prejudice, hate mongering and lies...it's all they can do as they have no real policy positions to offer that will make America work for everyone.
Not that dumb, laddie. They stopped buying Grand Caravans.
If ANYBODY on Earth knows 'sick and depraved,' primarily because they live it, then it would the despicable bunch of right wing Trump-enablers known as the 'State Department.'
What an asinine article and ridiculous comments.
' …just to be a little clearer, the subsidies are more realistically portrayed as being well above 2 billion a year.  .  SB21 alone accounts for 20 billion over a 10 year span, with a very real potential to go much higher.  . The debt obligations contained in SB21 as of today are only the tip of a massive iceberg of idiocy. .
Locals,,,, scary people!    Locals with alcohol,,,, even scarier!
Obama's intelligence briefings must be a pack of lies.
Trump is the ringmaster.  He makes press monkeys, political hyenas, corporate wolves, and streeping feminists shout and jump up and down in rage.  Moments later, he changes the agenda, and the fools lose the track.  This is going from the day one of his campaign.
Here she goes again...why are the ignorant and ill-informed always the loudest and with a "pulpit"?
Can't help but think of Bohemian Rhapsody.... though this guy is a miserable SOB. Probably more hit man than theatric clown.  And this is democracy at work. Wow.
Ahhhh the satisfaction of reading your rants due to your inability of being able to deal with losing the election. So comical and satisfying for me. Yep....you lost.....you supported the losers, you bet on the losing team......so. so devastating for you child. Temper tantrum much there snowflake?
Kag1982, Francis kinda did.  If you read carefully the above article [without naming him] Pope Francis called Trump a "stupid human" and 'a stubborn animal that does not see".  That's the polite way of expressing his thoughts about Trump.  BTW, those terms could be applied to many other people as well, including some of the folks that post on this site.
If it had been a christian or jewish cemetery none of these talking heads would say a word.  There is a word for their kind hypocrite
Show me that it's real. No silly alt-right blogs or other fake news purveyors allowed.
How can you not hate a guy who was a jerk during the debates from day one and still continues to be a jerk today.
United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001, and now senior Trump administration and military officials are recommending sending several thousand additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan  Here goes another 15-16 years of war, and another $trillion dollars of wasted taxpayers money. These fools will never learn.
I is a dump
Incredibly dumb post.
Denver should be a strong contender TBH.  It's easy to recruit young talent to come here, the city is centrally located, has a huge hub airport, and it's more than just a bland, boring business hub like, say, DFW (which is cheap, but in terms of attracting talent is about as sexy as a fat, hairy middle-aged dude in a Speedo).
And the President was correct - only 3 or 4 agencies who then spammed it. These morons thinks Trump is taking naps all day and not getting actual information???  Meanwhile the ONLY show Acosta's getting on is The Gong Show.
The PRC ambassador can apologize to Canadian taxpayers and provide restitution.   Otherwise he can keep his pie-hole shut, instead of making obnoxious and ridiculous demands on trade negotiations.
Ridiculous.  Alceste seeks to inject knowledge and understanding into these discussions.  If you feel that targeted.....perhaps the problem is you....
The media here lies just as much, they cover up the fact that the parasites are trying to ethnically cleanse white people.
Trump is a traitor to the United States of America. He willingly accepted help from Putin's Russia where political opponents and journalists are killed and which stole a large piece of a sovereign Ukraine. Putin is estimated to have ammassed $85 billion since becoming president. He is a cleptocrat and dictator....and propelled Trump to president-elect. As I write this I think of many the members of my mother's family who fought for the United States of America during WW2....only for their descendants to see this same country elect a fascist. Why? Were your educations so bad that you don't know enough to recognize it? Of her cousins and uncles and aunts who remained in the Soviet Union when my mother's Protestant  parents and grandparents emigrated to this country in 1905, only two survived their exile to Kazakhstan. The czars, the leaders of the Soviet Union and Putin: all tyrants. Think again about this traitor Trump.
Agree that long haul trucks are "stupid" ... but saw some fuel efficiency numbers claiming that per ton-mile rail and truck were almost equivalent in terms of fuel usage. I don't believe it ... Note that cars are grossly over powered in terms of steady state demand for HP thus batteries are OK. Trucks run their diesels at much higher average power levels.
Idiot.  And idiotic for ODFW to turn it in.  They should've been charged.
You're happy to purposefully 'step on the rights' of black, brown, AND WHITE people( that's what you meant by 'these people', right? we all know it) when you speak of confiscation of all handguns/semi-automatic anything, and making sure no one is allowed any long guns unless they meet your strict storage laws, but mention a crackdown on any 'particular area or particular persons' and you'd scream OMG RACIAL PROFILING  MY RIGHTS MY RIGHTS DISCRIMINATION NO etc etc.  Funny, most of the meth heads, shoplifters, thieves, low-lifes, and drug dealers in my neighborhood are white... no stepping on rights of 'brown or black' people here... didn't see that in the article either... hmm...
No. The ignorant are particularly vocal about their resistance to helping others in need.
Its like  the old saying, "If you get in a fight with a Pig, you will get slop on you".  Well, the slop is in the form of a 6 figure $$$$$ settlement.  Shame on Mr. Kamkar.  There is NO HONOR among SEX PERVERTS................
M:  No, it is idiots like you who have no idea how someone voted but snark anyways.  Besides why do you care, you are one of those who doesn't vote anyways.
Silly strawman. No one's making that argument regarding this attack.
Once again, thank you for a useless comment.  Maybe you ought to take to twitter like your buddy.
Bring that cheap crap to my door and we'll see who's just "loud"
if some idiot thinks my canada includes alberta is hate, they are exposing themselves as the alt left lunatics we dont need
that goal is pure alt left stupidity brain washing bs
"He didn't attack us." Reminds me of the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, the British officer tells Sparrow he's the worst pirate he's ever heard of, and Sparrow replies, "But...you have heard of me." Well, yeah, just because Donny Two Scoops didn't condemn you doesn't mean you aren't losers.
Trump / Putin's Poodle or O'bama/ Putin's bitch....
Reason # 13 why we need to REPLACE at-Su Borough property taxes with a sales tax.  Taxpayer are tired of having our hard-earned money be misspent by idiots.  #ferry #railextension  #meatplant   #dairyfarmers
Shut up, Pitts. You are one of the biggest racist in the media.
I encourage every law abiding citizen to go out of their way to avoid spending any money. I do and though it may not be much I refuse to support this idiocy
Now, only if his boss quits along with all the other useless MPP's driving this province into the financial abyss!
How many brain cells does a fetus have at 9 months? Probably more than you.... A fetus is not a fly.
Change the channel, then. Good dayem grief. I'd rather read this than that stupid reality show drivel.
I am really getting tired of  deflection  from the important problems facing Canadians from most of our politians  and the media that prints it. How about doing the job that you got elected to do! For the media forget the crap, and report FACTS  from both sides
Only if the profits stay in Alaska. Why should Alaska's gold go to a foreign country while Alaska initiates an income tax? Do you think that Norway invited other countries to get rich on their fishing and oil? Who can be stupid enough to trade billions of dollars for a few truck driving jobs. They think Alaskan's are stupid, are you?
Awesome, I wanna play! How about, send this scumbag back to the third world cesspool he crawled out of. How was that?
Or invincibly ignorant.
Well, there is where we disagree then. This may have been a lesser of two evils contest but there was a clear winner of the most evil prize and his name is Trumpty Dumpty.
How childish is your comment. just like you
aa poor lefty, keep crying that your gal the liar in chief 1005 of the time lost
testing purposes:   you are an idiot and i can't stand ignorant donutholes.
What a piece of human garbage.
Sadly, many Americans ignore statistics and instead substitute reality with the subjective notion that having a gun is safer.  I think they do know it's not safer but they are basically saying they don't give a crap about others and just want to have a gun for their own selfish reasons.  It's the same idea behind owning a monster truck.  Sure, I may flatten your sedan in a collision--sucks for you.
No foreign enemy of America is ever going to attack Trump. He's the best thing they could hope for. A bigly ignorant, lying buffoon who's dragged down American stature in the world from 64% to 22% in six months.  Also typical of Trump to shaft US taxpayers again.
Once again, Kathy Wynne is reproving that she is an economic imbecile.  Expansion of rent controls will NOT increase rental or properties for sale one bit.
His company owns a battery factory.  I'd expect that if enough lithium was not available, these cars would not be manufactured.  Businessmen are not automatically dumb.
Jinx, you're a classic scumbag, dirty cop. Whether someone is a "felon" or not is irrelevant. What other derogatory labels can you affix to folks? How about Nigger? I'd also like to point out that you have no way of knowing who anyone on the internet is, as it's anonymous.
When the next false flag operation occurs under the administration of President Drumpf, the right wing evangelicals and neocons/theocons spread their message of hatred to fool the sheeple into cooperating with the outcome.  Warning: they will soon wear out their cap locks.  This is the real reason that they had to have another moron in the Whitehouse and why the mainstream media gave his campaign $5 Billion in free advertising.  That is what got Trump elected and don't you forget it.
@jamesmason771 China absolutely does NOT execute drug criminals at every level. Look it up! Not defending these scumbags, but that is not even close to being true.
Yes Also pathetic? Austin Matthews lack of support for football players who protest during the anthem. Truly sad. But what can you expect from a rich, white jock?
To say the very least: the priest acted irresponsibly.  I think his bishop should be notified.  In the first place, the man may and probably does need professional help; and in the second place, the priest and even the diocese might find themselves on the wrong end of a lawsuit if someone does something stupid after reading the "joke."
A year ago I said this was coming and its only the beginning, the shear stupidity of some politicians is beyond believe.  One million cult members to disrupt a western country will not end well.
Pot users are taking a stupid drug. It's called pot.
Omari and his crew are thugs and shakedown artists.    They prey on the gullibility and laziness of people like you.
... if super fakey sexist racist bigot 'christians' had their way all those they condemn would be outlawed n burned at the stake ... like the good ol' days.  You guys have lost your grasp on MOST seats of power and ability to do serious harm ... but you are TRYING to keep the old days going w the likes of Cheetolini.   I'll celebrate when your ilk all die.
Sword needs the clown mayor to tell him that?
What was there to "debate" internally at the White House to denounce in unambiguous terms the actual ONLY side at fault: the derplorables that are the white supremacists?   How much that might affect Donnie's approval numbers?   Sickening. Disgusting.    And Bannon, Gorka, Sessions and Miller must go. And there had better be no pardon for that awful human being Arpaio.
Keith Olbermann: What an intellect deficient person you are. I wonder why any organization pays you to spout meaningless nonsense. You are one common sense deprived person.
This is an embarrassing article.   Subway is good because people live in Scarborough? Well...do they live near the subway? No? Maybe that's not such an important metric, then.   The LRT will only cost slightly less than the subway? Well, even if that's true, does the LRT serve the same people as the subway? Oh wait no...it has three times as many stations and serves hundreds of thousands more people. Is it worth spending more money to serve fewer people?   I guess Marcus Gee thinks it is, because we've made a decision and we should stick with it. No matter how foolish.
You think that I'm the only one who could do it? When somebody makes a fool of themselves like you do it's best to leave it up...so that others realize you're a twit.
Trump and his people are as evil as they come.   Trump is working directly for the devil.
With articles like these, CB will soon fall right into the same category as CNN.  I'm sure my post will be declined like all my other posts about the media.   Truth hurts, but how American is this??!! Simply idiotic on the writer and CB for allowing this.  Go drink all you want if this gives all of you liberals the liquid courage you need to destroy America.  Simply amazing!!
Yeah, I thought this moron president* was going to be just so darned BUSY? Or that is what he claimed on the campaign.   Now he's crashing weddings and playing golf at 10x the rate at which Obama's golf-playing made him whine and whine on Twitter.
Yup he is in the same position as an employee. What a coincidence, all employeees have to worry about these same issues I can understand why Trudeau/butts/morneau would want him to be taxed the same.  The trio of fools are such morons.  If he thinks his cashflow issues are challlenging now, the new tax policies (which make taxation so much fairer) will drive this builder out of business.
Then you are foolish. What you say is that you don't think you have the authority to make up your own mind, and so delegate that job to people who are motivated to lie to you, and to grant themselves more power. What the CONSTITUTION says is that the feds HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO OWN land outside a few very specific situations...that is, ports, forts, territories (and the west is no longer a territory) and 10 sq miles of DC. They do not have the authority to dictate to people how they can USE their own land...anymore than they can harass and intimidate people into selling them property as "public lands" which they then ban the public from using. Furthermore, any laws made to the contrary are UNCONSTITUTIONAL and therefore illegal.
Funny I didn't notice an advisor of Obama and Bill Clinton mentioning   "global conspiracy"?  "How about an advisor of Obama and Bill Clinton discussing an uninformed population being beneficial to the Democrats?"  Appears more like the "Village Idiots", of the democrat base Hillary's Campaign Team was discussing in their e-mails.
what a useless jerk, abstaining? the act of a coward, you are there to participate this loser needs to resign
Spoken like a true resentful, angry, paranoid, mean, screw-everybody-else-but-me, patriotic white American, congratulations. How many times did you vote for Trump anyway?
People need to really learn who Kevin O'Leary really is and what he hasn't accomplished. If those who are so enamored with his style and faux ability feel they would like to live under his rule (which is how he would view it), why not just move to the United States where that perfect storm has all just been created.   Why do you feel the need to duplicate it here?  As a fourth generation Canadian whose father and grandfather both fought in the the world wars to keep me free, Kevin O'Leary would make them both literally puke. He is a self-serving, narcissistic egomaniac that cares nothing about you.
pretty dense person lacking empathy to walk into an angry town protesting trump comments wearing trump gear, how stupid and antagonistic ,he is no victim.
When the biggest turd on the liberal swamp says this,  wtf are we continuing the subject?
Morneau's words completely contradict what the experts say who know what risks taxpayers will actually face and what everyone is warning this idiotic government about.  The Liberals will probably plow this through much like the faulty Phoenix payroll system they were told wasn't quite ready and to hold off deploying....... by why listen to reason when the idiot voters don't react much when they triple their deficits.  Blowing $25 - $30 billion annually is acceptable for Liberals but be damned if we allow a $1.9 billion surplus go through by the Conservatives.
Donald Trump is most likely FAS (Feta Alcohol Syndrome). He has all the symptoms.
sorry brain washed kookaid drinker, the ROC understands that lunatics like you are fools of alt left kookaid ,, the climate is not heating up to any catastrophic level, and not being done by mans carbon, there is not one shred of evidence to prove it,, lunatics like you are what we need to move on from and taxes dont fix anything for the environment such,,
All elections are subject to scrutiny. Its the law... BIG DEAL... more pathetic hype from the manipulators and liars. TRUMP 2016
creation of life is not a religious fool issue, its a biological and human rights issue.    when we as a society devalue human life to the point that inconvenient consequences of poor life decisions can simply be rebooted by killing the innocent life, what's the next step?    as soon as a person retires from the workforce they are aborted/euthanized/terminated/murdered simply because they are now a drain on society and using up social security and healthcare resources?    what about the mentally and physically disabled, eliminate them if they aren't working and paying taxes?    its not a religious "fool" issue, its a respect for life issue. hard to comprehend that those who claim to be liberal and progressive and everyone wins and gets a trophy are suddenly so callous about a preborn human being.
There is net emigration BACK to Mexico, you moron. The 40% you cite has been going on WAY before Trump took office.
What a pile of partisan crap I hope, Mr. Gower, you did not spend much time writing this article. This is awfully embarrassing for you. The uninformed masses are the democrats voting base, as the outrage against voter id laws and curbing illegal immigration you rail against. You dems make up reasons to attack and lay blame on all of us "uninformed" for everything you do not like, while encouraging your so called leaders to raise our taxes AGAIN! You are a clear picture as to why the democrats lost so badly. You are snobby out-of-touch elitists that think they are smarter than any blue collar worker that is FUNDING your nonsense. Grow up! Go introduce yourself to people that voted for change. You might surprise yourself with everything that you do not know!
They actually are stupid enough that they think they can just make up a new label 'alt-left'. They truly are that dense.
Why is a worthless Ibiotson opinion attached to a supposed news briefing?  Is trickery the only way to get people to read his deceits?
Well here's some lyrics from one of his most recent hits "Rap God":  I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table Over the back of a couple of faggots, and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact  You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'? Little gay-looking boy So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy You're witnessing a massacre Like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy "Oy vey, that boy's gay!", that's all they say, looking boy  Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad 'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad Singin' to a man while they played piano  But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons, make lemonade then! But if I can't batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?  One for good measure: Don't be a retard – be a king? Think not
As I read through the first ~50 comments I saw a lot of ignorance being displayed. Yes, Trump is/was controversial. So is/was Hillary.  I took the historical perspective and voted for Trump.  Clinton's baggage had too many skeletons in it.  I'll not list all of them here. Suffice to say, she was a loser.
It was lovely to watch informed, educated, intelligent and experienced professionals call Little Donny Trumplethinskin an idiot and a liar in Congress and on national television.  Little Donny is a fool and an idiot.
Of course the liberals are cheating, it's what they do, Thank the liars in the media for foisting this corrupt and incompetent pack of fools upon us. If not for their lies we would still have the best PM in the last 50 years still in office.
Actually , Trump is going to get more support. People are tired of the left and the racist Bigots in the media. CNN, ABC are the worst scum on the planet. Just like 2 months before the election poles and people said Trump has no chance. But people can't stand how racist the dems have become and how much cheating they do. Just last week we found out the only state Hilary won was California and we found out she got a few million votes from dead people. Thats how pathetic the dems have become.
Tweeting From the Safety and Comfort of His Golf Resort In New Jersey,   Trump Can't Stop Attacking San Juan Mayor   What a vacuous buffoon he is.
Is HiLIARy so dumb she does not realize the reason she lost was her?
Wits?  Our PM is a complete moron who needs Butts to spoonfeed him his lines.  Why is he the worst attending PM in the House of Commons in recent history? Because he can't speak off the top of his head in Question Period and struggles without rehearsed lines so the Liberals purposefully find reasons for him to leave Canada.
The IRS is a criminal organization, another tentacle like the "Federal" Reserve. America's KGB.
Trump is a wonderful hypocrite.  Cartoonishly hypocritical even.  I do however find it ironic that Milbank seemed to unknowingly mock Democrat's hypcorisy as well with the paranthetical gibe "(no taco bowl".  We all remember the leaked DNC email referring to their Latino outreach as a "taco bowl".  I'm assuming this was not done on puropose.  Either way, well played!
You are right Phil Kidd, and whoever the library employee was should be disciplined for saying that to you. Besides the stupidity and ugliness of the remark, the employee was "on the clock", and it is outrageous to think that the individual thought they had the liberty to make that kind of comment to a patron.  Intolerance and lockstep thinking coming from the "left" is just as corrosive and damaging to democracy as it is coming from the "right".
Quotes like these make the writer come off as a moron.  "Certain chemicals derived from cannabis may kill tumour cells in a Petri dish, but so does bleach." - Really? You're comparing marijuana with bleach... How much weed does it take to kill someone - how much bleach?  When referencing high potency oils, "At these levels, "you're going to make [patients] completely psychotic and sedated."  Reefer madness much? People are on dilaudid or other opiates when they're at the end of life stage. If they want some strong oils then it's their choice. Marijuana will be legal in less than 1 year, and this hysteria about high potency marijuana needs to end.   Think of it this way, if you have 5% beer you can drink 8 beers and get the equivalent amount of alcohol in 355ml of 40% liquor.  Who's going to stop you...
Will they be shutting down the afro-centric schools, or LGBT only schools?  How about the indigineous only schools in the TDSB?    If this is about 'equality' and diversity then these costly accommodations need to be scrapped immediately as well, since they are nothing but forced segregation disguised as diversity and equality.  Typical hypocrisy from the social justice warriors, push junk science and mediocrity like womens studies, or LGBT studies or forced native lobby indoctrination.  There's a reason they hate math and science and focus on stupidity like this, they take the money from the kids that work hard and find employment, and hand them to idiots who choose to demand things from everyone else under the guise of 'equity', lets call it what it is, Communism and Totalitarianism.  Hey TDSB, look at Zimbabwe and Venezuela, communists have killed millions and contrary to SJW beliefs, Communists have a very corrupt .001%, and those regimes weren't pretty at all.
“I am not a racist,” Leitch said   Wrong.  And your burglar sounds like raccoons.
39.5 per cent of Canadian voters showed that they were both dumb and desperate on October 19, 2015.
You're right, Arnold was the prosecutor not the defense attorney.  And, as you mention, that is even more ironic......or in terms of using good judgment...moronic.
Jones is another ignorant. The US flag code says to stand with your hand over your heart during the anthem. Couple weeks ago he stood and locked arms with his players. His hand was not over his heart. He was disrespecting the flag as much as anyone who has ever knelt.
So we have to put up with these useless parasites once again - who pays this time?
It would be enlightening to know just what perceived or actual slight turned Maureen Down, an acid-tongued scorpion, against the Clintons in the first place, but here she dances vituperatively on their political graves. Take heed your enemy, Chelsea!  The history books of the future will portray the Obama administration as the forces of light engaged in a sinister battle with the forces of darkness. Overall, Obama led the nation through relatively comfortable times, at least from my perspective. I will have to find out how to prosper under a new leader who, at this point, is a pig in a poke. With emphasis on the PIG.
I'd like to see you have time to pull a gun out when a moose jumps out of heavy cover right onto your back. A word of advice: Don't call people idiots until you know the full story.
ex PM of canada MADE SURE he will Screw Up the canadian Taxpayer. 11 Million $$$ for this guy and another 9 Million for duffy. So canadian taxpayer still PAYS harper AKA LUCIFER $180,000 pension on top of the MILLIONS $$$ he gets in KICK Backs from the different groups that RECEIVED FREE TAXPAYER money (OIL< BANKS< PHARMA ) to name a couple. This makes canadians some of the MOST STUPID people on earth !!!!!!!!!
Merkel's immigrant policy that was rammed down everyone's throats has destroyed Europe. She is also a climate taxer Trump has given both idiotic policies the total FU  That is why he is so popular  This is why the left hates him.
He looks pathetic and needs to retire.  I agree that ego and the need for cash are driving his staying in the ring.
Why did they ask/pay this piece of human garbage to perform.  He is a racist pig who needs to go back to Mexico and practice his hate there.
Yes, but equally the vast uninformed, mostly guys like you who don't know what they are talking 'bout, which yours truly has pointed out again and again.  Shall we refresh?  Nah, you look silly enough already.  Yeah, the fact that you even posted this nonsense, it makes my point, drives it home.  You simply do not know.  Stick to trying to insult, it suits.
Sure he did you bumbling buffoon.
As a supporter of the American enterprise I am astound at their stupidity (let alone lack of morality) in dealing with the Kurds. The Kurds hold an unconditional allegiance to the West and have instituted a form of government that is closer to a democracy than any other government of the surrounding shitholes (Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey). American support for them is a smart and moral imperative.
Frump is a bully and coward. Our delegation will stay silent and tomorrow will bring another stupid comment by Frump.
I expect this kind of sedition from a freaking rat that was raised by a couple of degenerate communists. Hey Carl how'd that Ukranian genocide of 1933-34 work out for your traitorous parents. What do you expect from a disloyal dirtbag.
Nope.    An apologist who bows and genuflects to inferiors  when nothing requires an apology at all is still a cowardly, whiny little slug.
Thank for whitesplaining and fat shaming. God knows  we wouldn't want to elect a man who gropes ugly women.
babies TROLL
And all of this is offered without proof.... The CIA won't comment but politicians jump in and cry foul......! Obviously, no country wants outside interference in an election but - "whoever" was leaking e-mails, what did they expose? A bunch of political, underhanded garbage, actually disgusting with Democrats behind the controls. Bernie Sanders, a likeable guy, honest among other things. But nope, the fix was in - for Bernie..... And the part about Obama not wanting to interfer? That's baloney! I've never seen a sitting president (and his wife) so involved campaigning for a candidate - they were bending over backwards, out everyday on the hustings......!
What about family and friends of these mass murderers?  Why are they allowed to stay? Lots of them knew and did nothing.  Do we really want these kind of people here in the aina?  Say no to mainland mentality clowns chimp and whapson.
I hate this PM but this is because of the previous ASSHOLE !!!!!!!!!!!!
Family Trusts are often testamentary trusts, bequeathed at death from tax-paid money.  There is no tax dodge here.  Instead of bequeathing money into the hands of minors and infants, a Trust is formed where ALL income each year must be distributed to beneficiaries by a responsible person - income remaining inside the trust is taxed at a the highest rate.  Trust tax rules have recently changed to become much less attractive from a tax perspective.  Sheer is a hypocrite on this one.  And, anyone can form such trusts on death.  Farmers and businesspeople who have large pools of capital captured in companies can do an estate freeze and transfer the newco to family members.  There are may ways to skin a cat.    The idea that the proposed changes will cause every fat cat to suddenly freeze in their steps and take a big tax hit is ridiculous.  Anyone smart enough to form a personal corporation to sprinkle wealth is smart enough to find many new ways forward that will work under proposed laws.
So at least two of Trump's KGB handlers dropped by the state and the locals bowed and scraped.  Disgusting.
This woman is a menace!! Another example of violent career criminals who have no intention to change and will continue to hurt anyone they  feel like hurting.  Get this lowlife scum off our streets!! WTF is wrong? People, wake up! Our justice system is a joke. Punishment for crime is a joke. Repeat offenders are a joke. Sentencing is a joke. Bail is a joke. Bottom line, people the joke is on us! We are the ones that pay for these asshats. We are the ones they hurt. We are the ones that live afraid to go certain places at certain times out of fear of these people. Nothing will change or get better until we realize our justice system, laws, punishments and how victims are treated is addressed and completely changed. When is enough enough? When are we going to take back our city and protect our people??  I am so frustrated by the way American society has changed into a haven for criminals and victims don't get justice. By God forbid we don't give sexual predators & rapists free lawyers!!
"Are you and Roy husband and wife by chance? What a angry, depressing house hold it must be. Poor children." THIS WAS CENSORED AND DEEMED INAPPROPRIATE. YET IT IS OK TO CALL OUR FUTURE PRESIDENT A BUFFOON, A TRAITOR AND A TREASONOUS BELLIGERENT CHILD? Talk about being fair?
Wrong country.  The last thing we need is more stinkin' Canadians coming to Anchorage every weekend .
Is Marble as smart as an 11 year old?  Obviously not!  Are the people who voted Marble into office as smart as an 11 year old?  Obviously not!  Colorado is soooooo screwed!
Licensing reporters is stupid. Why do you hate the Constitution?
Yeah, a partisan public service is not a problem. Right... The stupid and uniformed voters need to be saved by the self appointed guardians. A Venezuelan approach to governing, no? And Cuban, Russian, Chinese, etc. Is that what we need since the democracy failed so miserably in America? BTW, all things being equal, substitute Trump with Hillary and this article would never be published, let alone written. Partisan journalism seems to be a problem as well, it would seem.
They are like energizer bunnies high on stupid. Running in circles tossing one ridiculous idea out after another. ATWOOD BLDG. Simple.
Awwwww I'm so sorry you hate it! Then stick that pacifier back in your mouth and go pout in the corner! BTW, make up your confused mind, either call me dimwit or Col Sanders, but you can't have both!!! Your mommy said so!!!
The ugliest, biggest kid is laying in wait to enter the White House. Alone and without his centerfold immigrant wife number three.  Now she has Little Hands by the short hairs.  Hahaha
Suki, I know klastri doesn’t know what he’s talking about. He’s talking out of his backside.
Stupid place for a gun shop in the first place!  So where is a good place?
Stupid waste of time and money.
i dont care who else does it! its a scam and waste of our money on something that is not a necessity of life, its a private product,,  of course lunatic lefties like you live in the bias towards having others pay for your stuff over and over
This is just another poor article from a journalist who does not have a clue.  Pure sensationalism, not worth the space it is written on; feeding group frenzy.  Why don't they hire qualified people who have critical thinking ability.  Look at things in perspective.  First time buyers and millennials are struggling to buy their first homes.  Is that any different from 30 years ago when first time buyers where paying 15% interest and got a fraction of the real estate their parents bought?  This debate about the housing crisis is 85% garbage, written by people with a sense of entitlement and no perspective.   Our politicians are just lapping it up, because with their fat pensions, they only want re-election, economy be damned.  Where is the balance in journalism these days?  These guys are just fear mongering fools.
Walker is an idiot.  Calling the Assembly to blame the Legislature.  How lame.  Why not have a backbone and owe up to his mistakes?  Why didn't he spend time explaining why he won't significantly cut state government or put an end to his economically unfeasible and wasteful gas line fantasy project?  Walker can't be recalled soon enough.
NIMBY lives in Ottawa ...the fact that increasing carbon taxes in Canada only   moves the carbon production to other parts of the planet ,  clearly has not registered with  the dim whits in Ottawa ...various Canadian industries have been fighting this  losing battle for a long time , whether  it is  human rights or  environmental regulations , jobs continue to leave Canada to  go to regions  which grossly abuse both people and the planet .       This  issue is  particularly stupid  because we sell arms to  Saudi  to save jobs in a Liberal strong hold (London on ) and then buy oil from the Saudi for east coast Canada ...in other words the Saudis pay us for the weapons  with dirty . blood ,  soaked oil .      All of JT & co 's  liberal  hugs and kisses  and sunny way's  and  selfies  cannot disguise their  complete moral corruption
Candy coat it all you want.  Your outrage is still hypocritical.
This is hilarious (as in Hillary). There is no chance that Trudeau thinks for himself. And to cover up his illegal and immoral behaviour, he calls it "lobbying" instead of fundraising? Does he think Canadians are that stupid?
No class!  Ripping the kids off?  Disgusting.
So, if "his ill informed followers will eat this up like, etc" I 'd say that makes him a fairly clever clown.
Charessa: nothing in your letter has any reference to any kind of evidence that what you believe is true.  It's all your opinion.  What are you basing your opinion on?  We had hurricanes when Obama was the president and he totally bought into climate change.  But he was political, hence had ulterior motives. Don't be an idiot. Get off the climate change bandwagon. Follow the money.
People need to understand the facts surrounding this new mine plan before they pass judgement. The 'NO' movement are saying that they'll oppose the mine no matter what?  That's just plain old dumb. Bet they all have nice jobs and are sitting in nice houses
Nice recipe for hate. Thanks, G&M. Why not pick on apex predators in the food chain while you're at it. Damn sharks! How dare they oppress phytoplankton!
We may get a new president if the old one dies, or is removed by the 25th amendment.  I don't believe he is in the best of health. I have no idea what point you are trying to make with your second statement.  You republicans are in control and you should be passing legislation that you deem important.  For the most part you haven't passed anything.  I find it laughable that you idiots complained about Obama care for 7 years and yet couldn't come up with the votes to pass anything.  What jokes the republicans  have become.    I realize the Donald will never show us his tax returns as then he will be shown to be the fraud he is.  But since he complained about Obama's birth certificate, I can complain about his tax returns.  I could be demanding to see his birth certificate to prove his father was not an Orangutan
The press is the enemy. They have an agenda. Disgusting. They are fake news. Nothing they say is to be trusted. They have put our country in danger. Treasonous! I will never trust those bunch of pompous jerks, again.
Just because you are a cretin doesn't mean others are. I was reading college level before I hit grade school.
Another elitist sore loser
Trumps Leadership Qualifications: 1) He knows how to Twitter, 2)  His tactics emulate those of an accomplished and proficient con artist, 3) He is well versed in being a bully, an intimidator, and bull sh...er, 4) He can act  impulsive, anti-authoritarian, macho, invincible, and invulnerable, and even fatalistic, 5) He knows how to divide and conquer (although his capacity for organization and unification are doubtful), 6) He is willing to  extend his lines of communication and demoralize his staff in the face of superior forces, and 7) When necessary, has the ability to disappear behind a palpable and vile smelling cloud,  8) Over 35 (and of what kind of mind?).  Follow Trump at your risk.
What a piece of GARBAGE! Obviously written by a left wing nut that resents the knowledge, experience and power that comes with getting older. It seems that she (and many other clueless people) think that 'aging', working your way up and being a useful part of society in your 'golden years' is something to be ashamed of.  Being 'old' and part of society is not a dirty word, it's something to be proud of. Remember lady one day you will be an 'old white woman' how you going to feel then?
The (D)donkeys of the state are a bunch of babies.
Wait until all those wealthy "Trumpers" find out that their wives' Lexus RX crossovers are assembled in Cambridge, Ontario.  A 35% import tariff by the "Orange One" would tack on about USD $17,500 to a USD $50,000 car. Canada can retaliate, of course, but why?  Let Trump hang himself.  Also what is to happen to the thousands of American marques' cars and trucks that are assembled in Ontario and shipped  to the U.S. Market.  They are assembled from a lot of U.S. made parts made by, guess who, U.S. workers.    Another incredibly stupid idea from an incredibly stupid President elected by some really incredibly stupid people.  God forbid the "Great Groper" should think anything through.  Stay tuned, the editorial cartoonists will never lack for material with this fool.
A dumb 4$$ kid and a tweaker, neither of which are known to much intelligence.
Oh complete rubbish! Your rhetoric is not only dishonest it's a promotion of misery or death . So now you are putting your bias as having more credibility then licensed medical professionals? That is truly rich beyond belief, no wonder we have the word ignorance in the American language , and thank God it's illegal for non-profession unlicensed ignorant people to practice medicine.  I'm glad to note your use of the word "engage" which I will remind you is a verb an action word. Sexual activity aside from victims of illegal forcible activity is a choice. One either chooses to engage in sexual activity or not, regardless if the sexual activity denotes heterosexual or homosexual. Regardless if the sexual engaged activity is largely considered within so called social norms or deviant practices among society. Thereby both heterosexuality & homosexuality are a "lifestyle" choice, just as one may choose to be sexually inactive is also a chosen "lifestyle".
day by day all normal people wake up and start understanding what a huge stupid mistake they did when they accepted trans and gays...   just like any other "minorities" they will push their agenda and with the help of the state they will bully all the rest in the name of "tolerance"  the people of Canada deserve it, and more some of you think this "protects trans and gays"... wrong they are no more protected than yesterday... if an evil person wants them to get hurt... they will get hurt  actually this is damaging them beyond repair as people around wake up in a police state where their language and actions are under constant policing, they will start to see who the enemy is, and they will start to act  like in Europe right now, where at the roots, a growing anti-islam movement is spreading, even as the media and the state regulates more and more against it  it will not only become mainstream, but it will have a devastating effect down the road bad laws are bad, and stupid
This is the reason we need change from the old bastards club!
Ruthless; wicked; depraved; savage; evil; corrupt; arrogant; cunning; etc., etc.....do these (and more) adjectives apply to Reptilians?!
More lifeguard on duty, DLNR officers and the Coast Guard have to go out, babysit and make sure a bunch of drunk idiots are OK !!  This is amazing !!!
Absolute bloody rubbish. Trump supporters have the attention span of a Goldfish, with half of their working brain cells. These are people who sent money to Jimmy Swaggart, believe Saddam Hussein was involved in 9/11, and believe that Obama was born in Kenya and is a secret Muslim. Throughout the election they lappped up fake news posted by teenage Bulgarian scammers, and they're certain that Hillary was running a child sex ring out of a Washington Pizza shop. You and your ilk have utterly no comprehension of critical thought, and will believe anything that your rabid right sites tell you.
Tafoya. Your family name and you are a giant pile of  fesces.
Idiot isn't it, ben w?
the same way they can defend any of his terrible behaviors.  denial.  personally - i can't believe how dumb, naive, gullible, unaware, incurious, short sighted, unreasonable, nonsensical, ridiculous and conveniently forgetful some people are.
Ahhh when the bigots refuse to see their own  bigotry and start calling others bigots.   Riel you take the cake and are no doubt a typical bully type.  If Mr. Dallaire walked in the room and you had the chance to spew your venom we all know you would cower.
excellent article.   this was obvious the instant the computer screen was moved to the cell phone.  now most people have a personal 'idiot box' in tow.  a dumbed down society is more easily controllable.
Why was he carrying a large rifle? And why did he shoot it from a distance?   Because he's demonstrably stupid and a waste of oxygen.  If only he would have used his toe, to pull the trigger.
Spoken like a true Russian troll.
exactly!  But let us be honest:  Hawaii is dominated by non-whites and Trump racist base will be happy to see Hawaii wiped out.  Trump is a disgrace.
They're traitors against the US, stop worshiping losers.
Schiff is just another Dem' traitor, preferring PC BS over the lives of Americans.  Vermin like Schumer, Schiff et al. need to be eradicated.  That includes some GOP too like Graham-nesty...
And that's exactly what he is : a troll. It's like one of the worst little alt-right basement dwellers on 4chan were installed in the WH.    What kind of immoral moron supports "leadership" like this?    They like him because he makes liberals mad? I have a hard time coming up with a dumber and more childish reason to support a president.
You and your hero have one thing in common, at least.  NO ONE likes a liar and his "s**t sandwich" eating online astroturfers.   Off to your barn with the other stupid animals NOW !!!  BAAAAAAAAA !
I have trouble with a dumb 15 year old kid doing something utterly stupid and the benign educated wisdom of USFS GS 13 and above District Rangers and Forest Supervisors who watch fires,  do nothing,  for days,  while the fire is smoldering in one known snag,  and from that the Biscuit Fire.  This year,  on the same Forest,  a 1/4 acre fire was not suppressed,   for days,   because it was "too dangerous" for people on the ground to hike there.  Steep ground.  I guess a 747 with 20,000 gallons of water and a maybe half million dollar price tag for a water drop wasn't worth saving 185,000 acres of forest cover,  the  tree killing burning of part of Oregon's only native coast redwood stand,  with fire through the whole stand.  Oh,  and homes and out buildings,  private property,  destroyed.    You see,  tort limitations make suing the USFS a peeing into the wind exercise.  It costs more to hire a law firm,  file the papers,  and do the prep work to go to trial,  than any award would pay.
Who? And who cares? Enough with stupid lame manufactured Alaska unreality shows. Perhaps they spend a little money, but I bet most of the money leaves Alaska.
hey loser only 39% of voters were for him
The idiot as you say, did it himself. Yet you want / expect a company to pay something. I may be missing your point, but how can they be sued... Ohhh sorry, forgot to think that they have money. Don't sue the individual... Sue whoever has money... Throw a lawsuit against the wall, it just might stick.
Oh, Dave's message is insulting and beyond stupid but much easier to shut out . . . compared to the remarks of a community member.
No Dumb*ss, many people do it. It's a statement instead of having to reply to idiots over and over again.
Once again a Muslim causes a terrible atrocity and the world still rubs its hands.  Islam, is not a religion and should not be considered one so as to obtain "religious freedom" so cherished by the West.  It is an intolerant "way of life" that applauds death of all non believers.  A world wide organized crime syndicate comes to mind but under the guise of religion.  Humanity must expel its existence.  Now you know!
Blocking the reauthorization of the CHIP program while simultaneously advocating for spending on a flipping border wall is absolutely mind-boggling. There are countless examples of truly boorish, self-centered actions by the GOP, but this one is truly heartless. Tell me, reader: How can you possibly support these people? Because you're worried a brown man might take your guns? I don't know how you can live with yourselves. The Republican party and it's supporters are all traitors, idiots or both.
Stewart Phillip is an embarrassment to his people. He's the worst kind of FN activist, and not a person worthy of trust.
Inept and arrogant.   People  are hopefully starting to see how much of a mistake was made electing Junior  and his Keystone  Kops.
It is not good to have a PM who is vain, stupid, arrogant, and willing to sell (out) his country for 30 pieces of silver.   Harper was bossy and arrogant, but at least had a clue.
These people do not think, nor do they look for the primary source that was put into the propaganda spin and chief among the ignorant  is Chittester and her ilk.
Carl Bernstein is known as a malicious left-wing schmuck.
More childish nonsense from the PQ.
Kevin O'Leary might have been the stupidest guy ever on Jeopardy.
Hey dummy, he isn't Scottie.
From the Wall Street Journal: "The two sides unveiled business deals they valued at more than $250 billion, but were not actual contracts".  But of course Walker can't say the words "Alaska does not have a contract to build my gas line".  Because that would be telling the truth.  Much better to blow smoke at Alaskans and do a fake happy dance as propaganda for his next election, and so his buddies can keep getting their $550,000 salaries working on the gas line to nowhere project.  Pathetic.
This also clearly adds to Trump's racist, white supremacist pedigree.    Some of the people marching under NAZI flags in Charlottesville (all white) were apparently "fine people".  A part black guy, and other black guys, making what are actually a completely legal protest, albeit portrayed and communicated during the ritual of the singing of the US national anthem, is a/are SOB(s).  Trump is co-opting as well as linking the concept of Patriotism to White Supremacy.  Lot's of people do acts that openly "disrespect", and sometimes defiile the flag (as others point out, a constitutionally protected act),  Like, for instance, the Nazis in Charlottesville (including the "fine people" amongst them) who waived swastika flags in lieu of American Flags.  Trump chose the SOB moniker for blacks.    He's a racist, White Supremacist.  No doubt about it.
All this talk about "PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP" is MOOT. NO one wants to get INVOLVED in this stinking loser of a project!!!  ESPECIALLY when local government has PROVEN it's TOTALLY incompetent and mismanaged!!!!
You can't fix stupid.
Pathetic display of poor governance beliefs of both Quebec and Ottawa politicians.  That is why these governments are some of the ,post unproductive and incompetent in the developed world!
You have no problem with supporting their actions?  You don't mind feeding and clothing such individuals?  Brother, there's something wrong with your thinking.  And if your comfortable with rapist, you too must be a pervert.
Tar and feather trudope  and  wynne. They are a sickening pair. But hey, kim will end it. Let's hope kim gets these useless beings.
that is taxpayers money that is going into rewarding the pockets of incompetent management.  cut bombardier loose.  take it off the dole.  taxpayers cannot afford it anymore.  the trough is overcrowded with inept pigs.
Poor Bernstein, the people rejects you and the fake news rags.  Sure Trump is beating you and driving you crazy, that's a good thing. Take your failing lying biased media, Wapo, NYTs, CNN, et Al and shove it up your arse!
I don;t believe it's been established that whites break laws against crack at the same rate as blacks.  In fact, I thought the left's argument was that the crack laws are racist precisely because blacks violate crack laws more often, while powder is the white boys' crime.
How stupid is she? If you live in a State hundreds or even thousands of miles from D.C. chances are your doctor or hospital is not going to be in network!
littleyoboboy - Either you're drunk or your retarded.  Try proof reading your work before hitting send.
I think Mr. Chin is making an attempt at grabbing the spotlight for himself and the Democratic Party but it's a big mistake by upsetting the 'man' and party in control. Either that or his ego exceeds his bounds.  There will be repercussions and Hawaii residents will be the victims of a 'fools folly'.
They're definitely in a pattern of doubling down on the stupidity.
Randy:  You have become boring with the same items. So, I say goodbye with the appropriate comment on all your comments:  John Wayne said: “Life is tough and it is even tougher if you are stupid.”
Is this "Boss" post, a "Civil" post? Hmmm. Wishing actual death upon an organized religion. Nasty! Go back to sleep, Boss...
I call you a damn fool.
I am pro Obama..but you have a point. I too was pissed off when we sat back and did nothing fearing Russia' response. Now our president elect is Putins puppet.
Anyone who thinks Russia does not do that is fostering treason right along with Trump, the treasonous President Elect who openly asked for Russian help during the campaign!  And ignore the planted comments in these sections from the Russian cyber-attack establishment.  They are too stupid to be real.  No one could be that idiotic without an agenda.
Because of idiots like him the number of Catholics who attend church on Sunday drops off.  I say we support the Catholic Church on Sunday with black buttons in the collection basket till this crap stops.  Doesn't Catholic Charities accept enough federal money taking in all those illegals?
You think the economic problems are because oil producers over extending themselves thanks to near 0% interest rates,, ???? are you really that stupid!! yes obviously, blaming the oil crash and economy issues on interest rates here? god what an idiot,  the world oil prices crashed, are very slowly coming back but notley and justin are doing the damnest to keep it down with all the new taxes etc too..
BINGO!!!!!!!  And a 'disagree' from a sore loser.
After the sick delusional bum in there now, what do we have to lose?
If anyone wants who is responsible for this to be held accountable they should probably let the police do what they do best and solve the case. There is a reason none of us are law enforcement.... I love Courtney and miss her everyday.... I KNOW for a fact that the police are working hard to bring these people to justice. They have reasons why they operate the way they do and it is all for the greater good. Please let them do their job and just shut up. We owe it to court. RIP baby girl.
Why are you bringing their race up in your comments? And calling them stupid and ethically and morally challenged? Seriously, just keep those crappy, negative, and irresponsible thoughts in your own head Todd. Do you think because you have an opinion that this is an appropriate forum to express it? Act and think with compassion not judgement.
Only malignancy are the media and Democrats.
Sounds like Butts provided the Health Minister with the new talking points.  So carefully omitted was any reference to the 'deal' that Ontario made with doctors 15 years ago to allow them to incorporate and utilize these loopholes in lieu of doctor's fee increases.  Negotiated in part by none other than Mr. Butts while serving as a key Queen's Park adviser.  He knows that taking this away from doctors is disruptive, and by inference he seems to expect his former employer to pony up the difference (higher fees from provincial revenues).  How hypocritical, Gerry.
Amazing how such an ignoramus can become the President of the United States.  So embarrassing for them.
Not only are there no statues of Hitler, but Nazi paraphernalia is outright banned throughout the entire country.  Germany did the right thing after WW2 and declared they didnt want any of that crap representing their country anymore.  Too bad America didnt do the same thing after the Civil War in regards to the Confederate Flag or allowing statues to be put up of the racist generals who lost.
Until there are enough drug and alcohol treatment beds where addicts can get proper medical care, the notion that such prohibitions will reduce substance abuse are a total canard. This proposal is another layer of harassment, disguised as tough love, merely another obstructionist tactic by the noveau riche bourgeoisie and their crook attorneys.
"My beliefs are more important than your reality."  That's how absurd this is.
I have no intention of becoming a target of the racists on this site or the radical left which still exists in this town.     I was attending the U of O law school when your type of people blew up Army ROTC, trashed the Oregon State Police cars and were otherwise violent in your 'cause'.  I know what your hatred looks like.  I don't need your friends beating on my hood or ice picking my tires.  Anonymity also protects my family from your friends. Cowards often pick on the weak and unprotected.  I also don't want to have to shoot anyone stupid enough to show up at my house with violence as part of your agenda.  I require none of your 'validation'.  I don't respect you enough to care.  I have stated facts.  If you don't like them; tough!
Anyone who supports Trump also endorses his values: Bigotry, Intolerance, Mendacity, and Sexism. That includes Lisa Murkowski.
What is the reason for the Conservative Party being absent in BC? Sorry, perhaps a dumb Ontarian wants to know.
Politicians today are liars, cheats and useless tools. We need to step back to a time when the elite shut up and the men are allowed to straighten the scum out. But liberals don't want that, as they'd have nothing for distraction anymore. 2019 trudeau has to go.
send the lifeguards home. let survival of the fittest and smartest sort everything out.  if you're dumb enough to get slobbered in the ocean and die you most likely have the same irresponsible attitude on dry land behind the wheel putting needless innocent lives at risk.  do the public a service and drown drunk instead while keeping the sharks fed. now at least people can say you were good for something.
Wow!!  From the headline I thought I was about to read a fair, balanced Globe and Pail article referencing Trump.  NOPE!!  Opinion piece masquerading as news is simply propaganda.  Go have a chat with Sean Spicer G&M, you desperately need a tune up. The mainstream media is dead, people are getting sick of this constant garbage.
So he was a piece of garbage all the way around.  SMH.
He mocked the reporter's stupidity; the reporter has a crippled hand, not Parkinson's disease. Does having a disability automatically mean someone is beyond reproach? No.
How bout ripping up all stop signs and red light metal poles and recycle? since we have a town full of idiotic drivers who ignore them anyway why waste any more time or effort having them. sell the metal for cash and apply to taxes.
YOU - are a hateful, sick person. YOU - and yours are the reason why you lost last November why We, the People hired Mr. Trump. Get out of my society and take Kaepernick and Kiszla with you!
Absolute Rubbish: http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-people-who-went-school-obama-nev/
Democrats lied, people died.
Where does he keep finding these clowns? It's like a Netflix series.
The one person who was primarily responsible for this has not been charged - Ms. Zorawski's SON. He was the person whose stupidity created the entire episode. Had he not been selling illegal drugs to thugs and bragging online about how much money he was making, Ms. Zorawski would still be alive. He should be charged with felony "failure to do right" and put in jail with the rest of the trash that were involved in this tragedy.
More like ignorant bigotry.
This is what happens when the stupid people outbreed the smart people of our country - a moron gets elected.
Oh I'm sorry - I meant "the president all the racists love."
Capt.............................YES.............It WEEDS out the Bullies and Corrupt folks...............
Americans and their damn entitlement
Fox was just pure sleaze.  I hope they clean up the place.  I urge any woman who has assaulted to sue for millions.  Of it costs them enough, the guys will stop.  Just a horrible network full of lies for the imbecile trump
You are scum.
Franken is a drunk and he looks like a huge toad.
This is what you get when you put underqualified 1/2 price people in sensitive IT jobs that don't give a shit and aren't accountable (probably H1B people).  You get what you pay for.  What a useless corporation this is.
To A to the K--- I was raised in Willow AK & we lived on a homestead. We were dirt poor & had nothing but the fish we caught and moose meat if we were lucky. No running water, no electricity. At 12 I was cutting down trees with a chain saw & cording the wood in the back of a pickup & then go home to split the wood, so we would not freeze to death in winter.I was raised to have a conscience & held accountable for my actions, which does not seem to be happening with the kids today. If I mouthed off, I got slapped in the mouth. I have never, ever considered murdering anyone for anything. You cannot blame poverty.  You choose to be a P.O.S. or not. These kids have NO conscience.  For you to say it's poverty that causes people to be murderous is just beyond ignorant & pathetic.
Yet the national disease, known as "ignorant left wingers" will continue to cry that the rich don't pay their far share. Our universities are cesspools of stupidity. It's sad.
another clown who is part of the problem. They have greatly over fished the ocean, then blame timber for the decline of our fisheries. We need a 5 year ban on all fishing but this clown would scream bloody murder how it effects his livelihood. The math is simple, shut down the fishery that has depleted our stock.
Hey Chin, was it worth it?  Leave the big boy politics to the ones that can afford it....  totally foolish!
another useless Instagram moment by our do nothing Prime Minister what a joke  grow some cajones boy!
Well taxpayers of Eugene . What are you going to do about the incompetent elected officials? I suspect most will turn up the volume on the TV and let the fools get away with this little scam.
This is how it should've worked from the very beginning.  Signing on to bogus climate accords that allow countries like China to continue to pollute unabated while the U.S. (which already has some of the highest climate standards) is punished was absolutely moronic and, frankly, treasonous.
Wow you turned that into a racial issue real fast.  Maybe try not being so ignorant?
You know people can tell that your single up-vote is from yourself, right? It just looks pathetic.
Side note: Regarding the comment about Trump "allowing" his daughter marry a Jew. I'm not sure what century this person is living in? Does a man need to give permission to his grown daughter to marry whoever the hell she wants?  I suggest the author of this editorial put that bit in quotations, to clarify that these words are those of the Nazi scum, and not the author of the editorial.
Left, Right, Blue, Green, Black, Purple- who cares?  Stop threatening and attacking the Jews!  It's so goddamn simple people!  This is not acceptable in Canada or anywhere for that matter!  Get your ignorant, obstinate,  monkey heads out of your    a s s e s   and stand up against this sort of hatred!  This is not about politics, it's about maintaining safety for everyone.
West 11th is experiencing a pot boom. Confirm Sessions and watch all that evaporate. States Rights, as long as you believe what I do. Maybe we are all just hypocrites.
Raitt is ridiculous, a sanctimonious, nosey, prissy little you know what simply wanting power and control over other people's lives. She's gross, all of Harper's hanger's on and strained seals need to go. All of them.
Sure Lazee. Continue to rationalize your support of an idiotic demagogue with paper-thin excuses about "dumping a lifelong politician". Intelligent observers saw the differences between Clinton and Trump quite clearly with Clinton being a competent establishment candidate with clearly defined policy initiatives, and Trump being a thin-skinned megalomaniac in far over his head with aggressively bad policy proposals, where he bothered to come up with any, that is. Of course, no one has accused you of being an intelligent observer, have they?
I'm not sad. Toronto sucks.
Hopefully the republican establishment can keep Trump and Bannon in check and the sooner the better. Clearly things have to change and change fast before this buffoon gets us into a world war or causes another depression.
#MAGA  Morons are governing America.
Stubborn to the point of stupidity.
Carl, don't you have a deli where you can go to be a total ass?  Or is the ass just a symbol of your party?
Funnily enough, the majority only seem to insist it is improper to throw insults if Clinton is the target.  Trump is fair game for some idiotic reason.
Why are people (and especially, the press) unable to see the obvious: Trump is a white supremacist. He is a racist. This is not new. This is not some theory. His racism is one of the big attractions to his voters. The polls show this, his history shows this, and his current behavior shows this. It's like "The Emperor's New Clothes"!  No one wants to believe what is obvious!
https://youtu.be/oxcm69r6DQw   Here is the leftists Antifa starting the attack.   I am not surprised that crybullies still complain and play victim even though they started the attack.   Cowards.   And I thought they did not need the police?   I thought police as scum in their eyes?  Ah,  now that they need someone to protect them they run to the cops with tails between their legs like bitches.   What a surprise.   And yes police was on the side that was attacked and that was the anti-Sharia law people.
You have never been anywhere near the mideast,  I can tell,  you get all your information from false news.   It would be as if someone from the other side of the planet who had never been to Hawaii had said this,  "Hawaii is not exactly what people think it is when you're not on vacation.   Very racist.   Low education low achievement population.   No vibrancy everything is stifled by unions and bureaucracy and ingrained cultural ignorance.   Not exactly Silicon Valley or NYC."  You are a good example of poor information and lack of knowledge leading to racism,  bias, prejudice and the perpetuation of false news and misinformation.
Bradford Long, U R a douche! None of the protest makes any sense! The Rams recievers did their hands up don't shoot bullshit  over 2 yrs ago & I stopped watching then. ANY NFL player that goes along with protest bcs he is worried about NOT being PC is a faggot THEY CAN ALL be GARBAGE men like the fathers they DONT know or NEVER met. PHUC'em!
What a buffoon Trump is! Should he not have screened his Justice Secretary particularly well? I'm not a fan of Sessions and his racist past but he had no choice but to recuse himself when his contacts with the Russians were revealed.
Gov. Iggy is socially naive. Besides, being STUCK on STUPID !
It's cold and icy outside.....those damn Democrats!!!!!
Only a fool would give her money to buy Twitter.  She won't raise enough money and will then pocket what money she gets.
The scum in this town just keeps multiplying.  Anchorage is unfortunately becoming a terrible place to live and or raise a family.  There isn't a safe place in this town, just look at the crime maps here.  Terrible.
christ the guy lets a honest and vulnerable side of himself out, then predictably impulsive judgmental hypocrites throw imaginary accusations that they probably need to deal with themselves. Buck is a rare kind who has more sincerity than any of you best guess shit talkers here. he dares to take honest looks at himself and still keeps fans informed while doing it. thats fuckin guts you aint ever gonna have boy
Because right now someone else is paying your way when you should be paying YOUR fair share.   You conservatives are pathetic hypocrites.....no welfare babies while you demand your state "entitlement"n
' If things go as well as his other threats,   …the drug companies will be getting tax breaks and subsidies any minute now. .  Trump is nothing more than a con man and a buffoon. .
False equivalence.  Both sides are not equally guilty, just as Clinton, who has lied, is not even close to being the unrepentant pathological liar that Trump is.
Poor looser. She should tell her daughter Chelsea to stop making negative comments about world leaders. She is a nobody and she should refer back to her fathers many extra marital affairs. She was probably in her bedroom in the White House while her father was enjoying the company of white house interns in the oval office. President Duterte made reference to that in his response to Chelsea's comments. Duterte was wrong and should ashamed of making the rape comment last year. He has already received criticism from people all over the world. Chelsea Clinton is just like her mother, a looser.
Play calling sucks. We got out coached again. Rolo all mouth.  And UH football is PPV???....hahaha
Do not have a child if you do not intend to give your child a good life.Do not bring a child into this world that you abuse neglect & throw to the system which turns them into murderers, addicts, prostitutes. Get tubes tied or a vasectomy.I have yet to see a child that was genuinely loved that turned into anything but good. Stop bullying you ignorant young people . Stop your addictions you hebetudineus parents.Evan went through much abuse, he needed therapy,surrounded by kind people &.homeschooled,. There are many of us who were bullied,  now  grown, in our minds you are heartless creatures. We did not destroy you because we thought it was wrong, we did not end you because we wonder how your families would have felt, we did not because we did not deserve to be locked up for it,  we still think of you & hope your life is a living hell like you made ours.
Gillman, your an idiot!
I'm thoroughly opposed to the Trumps, but I'll be damned if I get on board with your slut-shaming. She can do anything she wants with her body. The idea of you trying to exercise control over a woman's behavior is more disgusting than any photograph.
Actually it is your answer that is nonsense...  The care giver to this boy who failed him and wasn't even around most of the time yet was paid $8,000 a month to supervise him was a PRIVATE CONTRACTED EMPLOYEE...NOT a public sector employee. You are full of shite !
Overdue for football to be DEAD. Much better to read a book that waste a Sunday on idiots destroying each others' brains. May the owners all loose their shirts. San Diego was so smart to kiss the Chargers good bye rather than subsidize a stadium for billionaires.
Get a load of these Hab fans like Motly, Lamey and Goatee Gelding.  Attacking me because their GM is soooo stupid to have traded away PKS - the real difference maker of this SC final.  TFF !
Yeah, Bauer, let's just all forget about the unabashed tRump and what he doesn't stand for.  Imagine that, a wannabe presidential candidate that never served one day in any elected position.  Narcissistic tRump actually believes that the US presidency is his by German birthright and being born with a rotten foot in his mouth.
Same here in Ontario, the gas companies are the pond scum of the corporate world.
A Texas red neck judge afraid of genders,   probably afraid they mite notice his small white penis.
It's not your job to fix this.  The harder your sister tries, the more pathetic she will appear.  She's looking to make you upset...don't react at all.  Don't overshare sensitive and personal information with her.
brad12>  Are you by any chance ANGRY at someone????  Couldn't be me, huh????  I can't figure out why you might be angry at me, because I'm calling it the way I see it, so who you mad at, huh????  Am I a "Nuisance Punk?"  I recall that it takes one to recognize another of the same ilk, right????  Ha, ha, ha, you make me laugh, you silly boy, ha, ha, ha!!!!
Looks like shameless anti-vaxxer flakes like you think getting polio is something funny?  BTW, you have it in reverse, it's not vaccines that need to be justified, it the your worthless anti-vaxxer junk-science...
Look at all this wasted money.  This is just so stupid.  Demolishing an entire school?  For what reason?  Ridiculous.
When did having babies become so ridiculous.  If you have a baby they costs money and you must pay.  If you have intercourse and it results in a "baby" you made the choice to sleep with that "guy" and what.............you thought you would be the one who didn't get pregnant.....really???   If you decided to abort, me the taxpayer for some reason has to pay???   And if you decide to have the "baby" then me the taxpayer still has to pay??  What the hell is going on ????   What happened to personal responsibility????????????????
These people are morons plain and simple! It is why I never fly Air Kanada!
Stop being ignorant and lazy and try reading a bit about it.
You had better watch your mouth young lady, or you'll get a severe tongue lashing from gary crum for being so nasty.
"Happy" I find it sad that you believe what you posted. I am White and consider myself 'average' for the most part. I have NEVER IN MY LIFE thought less of others of ANY race for what they are, what they look like, what they know or anything else. I'm retired Military and have traveled the world and met many peoples, all have their good points... All have bad...  I only knew one black family until my 18th birthday and had NEVER seen an Asian person until I went to boot-camp for the Navy! In my LONG life I have done my best to accept people for what they present to me..  Trump is NOT a racist, you listen way to much to the crap presented by the left.. He poses NO threat to any of us unless you plan to break some serious laws. We needed someone to support the 2nd amendment, think of our Veterans, fix our health care system and balance SCOTUS.  We could not survive as a free country if we were socialist bunch of left wing nuts (like Bernie wanted) where everything is supposed to be free!
The Liberals borrow and steal to give to their rich friends.
pigs backslapping pigs at the trough.
Bunch of hypocrites...when their free ride is dying they jump.
I will bet anyone a Large Coburg Pizza  Co.  Pizza  that this IDIOT did not have a Valid Drivers License  and or Valid Insurance..........1 out of 2 invalidates the bet.............Just coverin my Gary Crum type bet.......  I believe Coburg Pizza Co. Pizza  is the best Pizza on the Face of the Earth............. BAR NONE.............
When I make a donation to a hospital I go directly to the establishment and hand over a cheque.  Intermediaries are slime sucking scum, sort of akin to real estate agents.  Also when one does a run for charity, best check out the percentages that actually go towards the charity.  A few years ago a well know 10 k run in Toronto had less than 10% of proceeds go to their advertised charity.  Fat cats chewing on the money flow from misinformed individuals.
For what ?  Matt Ryan fumbling and being total inept when it mattered.  Atlanta choked !
"The unwashed masses are coming for you and your ilk…."  Frod Nation and Harpo already tried that in Canada.  How did that work out ?  BTW Drumpf is an dunce capped fascist and so are you, apparently.
Crazy ship of fools with a clown at the helm. So lucky we live Hawaii yea?
This is "democracy". Disgusting.
Hey, you can poison YOUR kids if you choose. Sucks to be them.
To bad nobody got to these hood rats before the police...
The masses become more politically intelligent as they participate in elections for example, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a significant margin indicating that although Trump's racism, xenophobia, and misogyny were big sellers with the Christian Far-Right and aging whites, a majority of Americans did not buy the garbage he was peddling.
As a Canadian Conservative who voted against Trudeau and who utterly hated his father, Trudeau is merely annoying and economically naive. Trump, on the other hand, is a vile, disgusting racist who is tearing his country apart in order to boost his ego and enrich himself.
“I'm a CONSERVATIVE woman and let me clue you into one fact, most men ARE jerks.   Let me fix this sentence for you, most men ( whom you know personally  ) ARE (most likely) jerks. In my experience, women in particular tend to attract( and are attracted to ) those persons who are most like them, or who are similar to a person they grew up with whom they fear and/or respect. Then there are the gold-diggers...
we need to give all the butts to the commercial rapists...er I mean stealers, er I mean...criminals, er I mean thugs
F the homeless they can quit being worthless pieces of shit and get a job and make their own money for their own shit hole to live in. If they wanna be worthless and harass ppl, steal, commit crimes and do drugs they all deserve to rot to their death on the street. Try working right along fern ridge/Amazon trail and you'll see how much you love these lowlife trailer trash pieces of shit!!!
Trump's a liar. That's why Comey started making these memo's. If this was Hillary or Obama you'd be screaming for his head with all the other internet warriors. When will you conservatives for once put your country before your party and stop putting up with the amateur hour that is this administration?
No, a complete idiot would be a republican in Washington DC who pushes doing away with Obama care and throwing millions off health care,  Or an idiot who believes the very rich should get lots of tax cuts just because they are rich. Come on Donald release your tax returns!
The bill sucked to begin with and now it's becoming even more offensive. The Marxists have won, the stand-for-nothing, lie-to-get-elected GOP is beyond pathetic.
Who cares what the corrupt and beyond useless NEC does with Zuma their appointed leader. The ANC are toast at the next elections and good riddance. Our populace is slow but not that slow.
CNN! You people are sociopaths! Bernstein did NOT help get Richard Nixon impeached. He wasn't impeached, he resigned!
Globe And Mail (and all Canadian press), please take an oath to NOT give Mr. O'Leary free publicity every time he says something stupid and bombastic. He is an absolutely disgusting human being, who has created a fake persona for the simple goal of getting publicity.  Don't feed this monster.
You mean like the spewing of venom and hate against Harper! Too hypocritically funny!
Evidently you hold Ms. Swift in disdain. Would that you and the others that have jeered her could find her strength and courage. Then perhaps you would see a young woman that was groped in a sexual assault, and who responded very appropriately. Her attacker suffered consequences. (Awww....) then he mustered up the idea he could get money from her. He and his lawyer misjudged Ms. Swift. She is stronger and smarter. Meuller made an even bigger fool of himself. Ms. Swift has earned a lot of respect for her effort to resist and fight back.
You play the game, (stupidity has no bounds), you take your chances.  The network wanted the ratings is the only teachable moment.   Outing is so yesterday and the day before that....YAWN!!
Just admit it. Clinton is so corrupt and dirty that people had to hold her nose to vote for her.    And those same people conveniently go blind to her corruption now that she's the only democrat left.    It's kind of sickening that there are so many idiots that will vote for Clinton DESPITE KNOWING HOW CORRUPT SHE IS AND CONTINUES TO BE.
Nenshi is a pompous and arrogant ***. His Royal Purpleness feels he has the jelly to dictate to all lesser beings. It will be good to see him soundly defeated on his less than stellar record.
Polio/diptheria vaccines are not over-rated at all.  In fact they are necessary so I was putting helmets in the exact same category.  I'll say it again and see if you can catch on THIS time.  Helmets are almost as over-rated as polio/diptheria vaccines.  Now who's the ignorant one?
How ironic , stupid and economically damaging  that  Canada can negotiate the FTA  , NAFTA  ,CETA , the TPP  ,  free trade with Korea and others , but can't do it internally.    I would also ask why a license to practice your profession is only good in the Province of issue , and not Canada wide.  Are we truly a country , or just a bunch of Provincial fiefdoms ?
I only disagree with liars and idiots. Though in your case I am unsure which applies. It is not 'largely'. It is overwhelmingly. We do know that. Down to exact measurements. I already explained how we know. Either present scientific evidence disproving the USGS or concede. But clinging to an argument after I utterly debunked it with science is either extreme stupidity or blatant dishonesty. Neither will impress me. Repeating a lie does not make it true.
You nailed it.   A conservative is someone who wants to tell you what you can or can't do and how to run your life while objecting to anyone who wants to  modify their behaviour.      In other words a hypocrite.
Why is New England so good? Coaching, specifically Bill Belichick. Vance Joseph is garbage. PLEASE FIRE THIS AWFUL COACH!
My opinion: all the years I have lived and traveled around America I have seen more believers of CHRIST commit more blasphemies of the Laws of that belief than I ever cared to. American's and every other nations culture always feel that the other religion was demons and devil's. Each point the finger and crown themselves as GOD's chosen. But, what I can say as a citizen of this country is that Americans have become,over last 50 odd yrs, a  bunch of sanctimonious, self-stroking, self-righteous hypocrites. Fed by false prophets called preachers who have slept with the government to get rich and social gain and with that has destroyed this nation from within. Demboski/Trump/Palin/Hillary/Bush are the trash legacy this nation has been fed through lies and to me they committed the worse treason. They called it politics as usual. No I'm not afraid of foreign terrorists. These idiots spreading hate, lies and emotional and mental blackmail scare me more.Young people are listening and watching.
Talk about a ship of fools....Anyone who thinks that Clinton is against capitalism must have failed to notice how the stock market did under Bill Clinton, as opposed to, say, George W. Bush.  These guys think subsidizing Big Oil is capitalism.   Keller once again shows himself to be an incredible idiot.
I had a horrible experience with the DHS regarding my grandchildren. I feel sorry for anyone who comes in contact with these incompetent, lying, dumb-as-a-box-of-rocks individuals! God help kids in OR!
Trump is a coward. Great, he got the “Golden Ticket” from an doctor.  You do not talk crap on people that went and fought for their country like heroes.  Vindictive? Did you read th article? Are you paying attention? Trump is taking a dump on a war hero and he is a draft dodger.   That is great you voted for Trump, just don’t make the same mistake twice.
Actually, lying to your lawyer is not obstruction of justice.  It's just stupid, so that's probably what Trump did.  Trump's presidency is finished.
Trump is spectacularly incompetent at vetting and hiring.
Something about millions of people dead due to terrorist organization and billions spent on war and security measures that  has people a little more concerned than some local nut with a gun.  Truly wake up you sound foolish !!!
What a ridiculous comment.
Ignore Obooba's comment.  Just another brainless comment by Obooba.
How did all these people have such stupid attorneys. That's who they should sue. There is no science behind the claim to begin with.
you are a nut job, our mortgage system is not responsible you loser lib,
wow can left wingers never stop being so stupid! those farmers will have to charge MORE for thier products and thus we all costs us more and in exports they will sell less being less competitive.. thus less of an economy and less jobs.. and please get some help there is no catastrophic anything with GW and mans carbon, clearly you are brain washed stupid https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyUDGfCNC-k
How many hundreds of millions of innocent, defenseless citizens in Japan, Australia, and the US should be murdered by Kim because cowardly, ignorant progressives like yourself are not willing to deal with Kim effectively?
I just knew some idiot would try and blame the best PM we have had.
John, you're a liar.
...along with Vic and DonInKansas.   It is, of course, a not-so-subtle form of bullying. I actually find it rather silly and a bit childish - but that's just me.
We've had crooked Presidents before, and incurious, impulsive, mulishly "decisive" ones, but we've never yet had a mentally ill one provoking chaos in the international order, in diplomatic circles, in military matters, in the world economy, in everything.   And we've never had a dominant political party playing chicken with the well-being of the world.
OMG shut up already no one cares
"I did not mean that Conservatives are generally stupid; I meant, that stupid persons are generally Conservative. I believe that to be so obvious and undeniable a fact that I hardly think any hon. Gentleman will question it."  -John Stuart Mill-
Trump's personal lawyer is soooo dumb.
I love how he is targeting the illegals. Other than that, not much. He's a lousy speaker, the tweeting is annoying, and I really resent his bringing is family into his administration. VERY unprofessional. His sons are pure scum.  P.S. I voted for him - no regrets about that.
Don't worry....you're not the first pro-Trump simpleton to make the lame assumption that I am an HRC or Obama voter merely because I criticize Trump.  Unfortunately, you won't be the last.
So I guess you ride a bike everywhere and don't drive a car. I suppose you use candles and not electricity to power your home. I would bet that both of my assumptions are wrong because most of you environmental warriors are hypocrites.
Tita Girl>  As I previously posted - "this kid is no more than a punk and a coward.  Just like his old man."  This just goes to show who's the better parent.....POTUS wins hands down.  I hope this reflects poorly on his old man as being a dumb a_s that he is.  Lack of parental guidance and love.  Have a nice day.
Lampert will feast on the carcass of Sears until it is powdered bones. Man is a bloodsucking leech.
It just gets better and better. God, he's a moron.  Looking forward to impeachment of him and his freakish VP.
Ding, Ding Ding .....I'm fed up with troll doublespeak from posters who confuse freedom of speech with the right to spew hate and incivility.
When you are an employee the employer calls the shots.  These overpaid clowns are employees.
The Trump presidency is the "Ultimate Farce". If it was fiction, it would be a hilarious comedy.
No lies here mr crankypants except the lurid BS you claim are not. Enjoy the election.
Don't lend your car to idiots
LOL... Next episode of World's dumbest criminals...
Married priests are a no brainer, these men are already educated, ordained and ready to go. The deranged hierarchs that run the Catholic Church are amazing.....if you rape dozens of 8 year old kids you can say mass for the rest of your life.....if you marry a woman you are banned from celebrating the Eucharist. How many more parishes will have to be closed before the laity stand up to these ignorant leaders.
Oh it's a giant dUck in Toronto. I thought it said dIck but then remembered he is in Ottawa
I saw them do it on Mythbusters...But it still stank like crap after.
yes, I think that the baker who is sole owner, has the right to say that he will not decorate the cake the way that they want.  This is true for when KKK, NAZIs, Muslims, Christians, Disabled, White, Pink, Red, Blue, etc. Heck, even a Zombi.  I will not be using this baker because I disagree with what he is doing.  Look, the constitution gives us rights and freedoms. And a big part of that is the right to be jerks.
So you didn't google him, I see.  Go look at some images and come back and tell me he should be in the ladies room. He is the perfect example of why your simplistic 'theory' will not work. People would see him and call the cops, and then he'll produce his birth certificate and say, "This is PRECISELY where you want me to be. By law!"  Dang fools. I really don't get ignorance, but willful ignorance is inexcusable.
I'll bet money she was loaded on drugs that the foolish among us want legalized and "regulated."
garycrum:  Very good post.  I decided last night that I  am DONE Slinging the Mud with the Goddez.  There are a few commenters here that its just not wise to respond to or express with.   Famous quote by someone, " Do not argue with a IDIOT.  They will drag you down to their level, and beat you with experience".   I am smart enough to realize that this is the Goddez.
I can imagine your father must've  been a raving lunatic!
Yawn... More anti Canadian venom from our resident Yankee troll... See if you can defend your idjit rather than insult others...
Mitch McConnell is evil.
How pathetic can you get, now you "like" your own comment with two of your many names?
UMG another apology? and he cant just write one, he has to hire more people to spend tax money to come up with one? this PM is a total useless lunatic
Just more evidence that the State's elected officials are tone def to both fiscal reality and responsibility.  These sociopaths are completely inept, irresponsible and unrelatable.
Hypocrites.
Just another traiterous act by onumba. Why did we let him even near the white house. What is wrong with people voting for the buffoon.
If stupid was a drug, you'd have overdosed
How silly can you get?  How unrealistic can you be?  How ignorant of the system can you get?  If Trump drives him crazy, he should find good candidates for 2018, work for their victories, and spend his $10M on that. How can a billionaire be so dumb?
Trump's a blowhard.
Trudeau is such a disingenuous, opportunistic hypocrite. As Tom Cochrane would suggest, He's sinking faster than a sunset.   Too bad we're stuck with him for a few more years, he really is a major disappointment.
You're ridiculous. You want them to leave their babies in alaska. They have no family here, community but not family. They should in no way leave their girls here because it's a better budgeting plan! That's insane!
clearly you are only into being brain washed stupid
More nattering from NCR's resident hypocrite.
Typical sleaze bag politics that plays to the mindless urbanite and Atlantic Canada drones who voted in this assembly of clown-school graduates.
You are an ASS!  Written by Charlenes mom.  This is not the original response I typed, I took a couple deep breaths and wrote something not quite as to the point.
Conway is a pathological liar.
Congratulations.  You win the stupid award for today.
It’s our messaging. We stand around like  idiots while they  ask us  24/7.   And I do t get how our leaders of the party don’t push the importance of voter turnout
You are sick.
and why would you want to give our resource to China??? you want to profit by destroying BC for China while alberta- litterally - burnt itself to a crisp with oil fires and oil explosion already. You have to be insane.
Somebody needs to do something about these crazy white folk.
what is REALLY funny is the blatant right wing hypocrisy
He's having a mental collapse because a four star general keeps pointing out he is full of crap and doesn't know the truth about anything.  You can tell in his facial expressions that he can't accept reality and is starting to have a mental break.  It must be hard for people who believe this white supremacist garbage.  Their heads are jacked and they have a complete false narrative on history.
Yes Ford had horrible addiction issues  but he respected the little guy and his tax dollar.  Something the entitled status quo hasn't figured out yet  even with the rise of Trump.  Expect a 2nd term, your slow learners !
To avoid the unintended consequences, the numbers need to be examined carefully, first. Not feelings. And only then, the policy should be presented. Else, you end up looking like a know nothing idiot.
The times are dangerous because we have a buffoon as president.
It makes complete sense, Kiszla.  You're still an idiot.
I find it really odd that some companies still try to pretend they have the upper hand when the economy is doing well. I have no idea why they behave like this. I suspect that because the industry overall is driven for whatever reason toward younger people - and try to drive out older workers - that they have almost no memory. Certainly no concept that the people they are dealing with tend to be incredibly intelligent, and tend to network with others, and will tell people to steer clear of certain companies that don't project the right attitudes.   In other words, the evaluation done during an "interview" is a TWO WAY street, not one way. Companies that think they are there to interrogate a subject to see if they will sing and dance just so are doing it wrong. The people they think are there to plead their case for a job may have many other irons in the fire.   In a down market, the behavior of toxic companies is even worse. I've seen some truly awful and frankly, stupid, behavior.
That is the first thing I thought, if someone is idiotic enough to drive a car like that in the ice they deserve to get stuck.
[Donald Trump by saying the U.S. leader is "not my bride, and I am not his groom."] Would it be more accurate to say Trump is "my bitch and I'm his extortionist?"  Not that Putin ever would but this looks so much like him attacking a straw man rather than the point...
No, Ebes, just because you willfully fail to discern between credible commentary and junk doesn't make "all articles...fluff."  Yeah, I'm not surprising a guy shooting blanks all morning quits the debate. It would be one be thing if you were incapable of grappling with the issues, but it seems it's just willful ignorance on your part. I am pretty sure that's a sin.
Dumb.
Trump is a social liberal. He will say anything to get into power. I love that the republicans have to get behind him to save face; they are as stupid as a bag of hammers.
Ding dong, you are wrong. I would listen to you and your dumbocratic mumbling, but that would make both of us wrong. Look at it this way.  There is just no way to fix stupid. And the dumbocratic party is as broken as it gets.
If  you take a silly song and play it against a War back ground ,  you  can pretty much  conclude how the Politicians value their Citizens.       Now we have  Dreamers adding their idiousy to the mix.                 We are in trouble.         https://youtu.be/7CHiUN8XTWs
Stretching the truth to satisfy your partisan agenda I think. The liberals were ready to concede on a 5 billion dollar accounts receivable from the US. Harper got in and was able to collect 4 of the 5 billion Martin was going to write off to bad debts. Don' try to rewrite history because you think it will help Justin out here. There is no helping that fool.
our Pm is such a baboon.....no one respects him, he is useless and incompetent.  why is he prancing around the country as if he is "hot stuff" - he is pathetic. I hope those who voted for him see what he is really all about now.  Instead of helping Canadians he is helping his own cuases BUT WITH OUR TAX DOLLARS.  The power has gone to his little big fat head!  Number 1 goof ball ever.  How embarassing for Canada.
Yet you were mad at Harper and the Conservatives running deficits during on of the worst world recessions which somehow Trudeau deficits during non-recessionary times and projected endless deficits is somehow good, I guess the irony goes right over your head or is that one of the hypocrite talking points provided by Butts?
If only Trudeau was as smart and had balls instead of a p***y and got that Toyota plant to stay in Canada . Nope,  instead of that is shipping out billions of dollars to African countries to create clean technology jobs there instead of here. The younger generations of Canada will pay for his  foolishness but it turns out this will be poetic justice since they are mainly responsible for electing him. Good luck with that, oh you millennial fools.
"Populism is simply code for stupidity and willful ignorance." Spoken by a guantanamo a supporter of elitism. Elitists like guantanamo are delusional if they believe that they can win over people with insults by calling them "uninformed and misinformed ... who...  don't have the capacity to understand issues". If all elitists are as delusional as guantanamo they don't stand a chance against populists.
Labelling CNN as "fake news" from a guy who's peddled in spreading lies for years is a bit rich, don't you think?   (Trump:  "Obama wasn't born in America and I will prove it....";  "Obama's a Muslim";  "thousands of Muslims cheered in Jersey on 9-11";  "I didn't mock a reporter's disability". etc. etc.)   Karma's a %$#$%.
sounds even more like trump's White House dump
Hypocrisy, thy name is Christian America -- a group of which more than 80%  turned completely against the teachings of Jesus to support a lying, womanizing, racist, tax evading, ignorant, thrice married egomaniac who puts himself above all others, let alone the law.  You own this horror, Xtians.  What would Jesus do?
We DONT need DACA recipients to support our SS and welfare!!!! Since 1986 amnesty, the illegal alien population has increased from 3.6 million to 12-20 million!!!! DACAs make piddling little money and they and their parents and anchor rat siblings have BLED OUR COUNTRY DRY TO ITS BONES.  They cost us a MINIMUM OF 200 billion each year......K-12 education at 15 k each school year, ESL classes, overcrowding in schools, free medical (been to an ER lately???), 20k for popping out each illegal anchor rat, in-state tuition, incarceration in prison, judicial expenses for their false claims, use of infrastructure for free and sending BILLIONS in remittances to their country!   So, multiply 30 years (since 1986) times 200 billion = 6 TRILLION $$$$$!!!!!!!! SIX FREAKING trillion......for liars, cheaters, law breakers and THIEVES,!!!!  PRESIDENT TRUMP, RESCIND DACA AND DEPORT THEM ALL IMMEDIATELY,!!
Who amongst these people will condemn the racist xenophobia  presidential candidate, Donald Trump, or withdraw his or her craven endorsement?  Senator Murkowski: you, at least , should recall Sec. Powell's Pottery Barn rule: you broke it, you own it.
Maybe there are some donors so stupid to bankroll Kasich, but I doubt it.
Disgusting that we have to have murdoch filth in CO - go pollute some red state where your fan base resides.
My comment exactly.  And the Dumbacrats are right there with them peddling this crap.
Well, that was a lie-fest... Talk about pulling numbers out of your behind (insert eye roll here)... What a stupid article.
You're an asinine racist. I'm happy to flag all your posts and I encourage others to do the same.
Well, naturally Flowers is against immigration being blocked - that's her bread & butter.  Plus, it's woefully obvious that Trump and his "advisers" don't know their as*** from holes in the ground and anyone who doesn't see this EO is wrong is an idiot.  Otherwise, she's just as nasty as ever.
Rant? What rant? Just pointing out the idiocy.
ya as if you have a clue on engineering you lib sheep idiot, while taxi drivers actually work the vehicles,, give the bs a break loser
Hey fool give the bloated government your money no one is stopping  you...and when your broke go to California to get on the welfare
Well I googled "educated stupid people just looking for a paycheck" and all that came up was your picture.
I can sympathize with those that have just fallen on hard times and need some assistance to get back on their feet.  What I can't sympathize with are those that chose to break the law and leech off the hard work of others while contributing nothing to society.  I have no respect for these lowlife parasitic worms and wish they were all terminated.
RUSTY THE HATED SCREECHING MONEY SUCKING RAIL WILL CONTINUE  TO RAISE ITS UGLY HEAD AS LONG AS WE THE PEOPLE ALLOW IT. What is the proper way to STOP THIS USELESS MONSTER CHOO CHOO. What we need is a really good attorney to put the stops to this or a really good honest AG to really look into the graph ( where in Hawaii can one be found) or a REAL FORENSIC OUTSIDE AUDIT. Our City leaders are the worst on the planet and all need to be tarred and feathered for following PRP's instructons
whatever it takes to annoy liberals! They don't care how stupid they look,  by gum, to annoy those libtardz!
People would listen to Hillary and Nancy  if they stopped saying stupid things.
They'd have just blown it on corporate tax cuts and more feasibility studies of dams we don't need, etc.  The problem the state, and its legislature, have is having become fat, dumb, and stupid on easy money which was thought to never end.
These idiots went across the line, assuring themselves that they were protected by western power. They are now front line "thumpers", having established their "cred" in the missionary community, and we will hear from, him, at least, in future, ad nauseam. She, having emerged scathed by the hand of the heathen, will endure poignantly, and, one hopes, silently.
if nothing else this has given childish insulting losers like YOU something to post about, grow up idiot  ass for your impeach thinking you post ever day, man get some help for your sick delusions
I would rather share a bathroom with a transgendered person than a sanctimonious bigot.
There are literally thousands of cemeteries across Canada that are exclusive to Catholics, Protestants and Jews.  This is ridiculous.  Let them have their own cemetery.  You can't have it both ways.  This is Canada and this "referendum" is a pathetic joke.
Poor naïve....... 'Trumps support base'. Sad.
So there is no difference between an acorn and an oak tree.  Climate change is established fact. Only a fool or a liar says differently. So which are you, McHale,  a fool or a liar?  It can only be one or the other.
Having reviewed a few of your comments I can see that at least you have reached peak stupidity.
Sure, Vinis can think or feel that way about Trump, but as the mayor her public display of HATERED for somebody undermines her "welcoming" theme just because she happens to disagree.  It makes her appear hypocritical, childish, and unprofessional.
no on on this thread has posted more ignorance and stupidity than you jurbane,, clearly you are a koolaid cult drinker bent on living in a delusion!
What are you going to say to your grandkids in 10 years when they ask how could a maniacal dictator take over our democracy? Are you going to lie or are you going to admit you were a part of Trumpaganda?
2016 year of stupid for many people in the big house.
Some idiotic statement made up by a cowardly misogynist.
Pay for your own damn hormones and don't expect the military to deal with your mental issues.
if this crazy female take a dump on my driveway not once, but multiple times and she will be prosecuted, after I film her. She will be identified, and she should consider herself lucky I do not take stronger measures to stop her in her tracks.
Its pathetic to see the outright scorn for the less fortunate on display here. I'm doing OK myself, but would like to see more fairness for the working poor. The wallet-clutchers out there get bent out of shape at the mere suggestion.
.  "After the meeting, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson referred to Trump as a "moron" "  --  This is "fake news".  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson didn't refer to President Trump as a "moron".  The Secretary actually referred to President Trump as a "****ing moron".  https://www.commondreams.org/news/2017/10/11/tillerson-moron-comment-followed-trumps-call-massive-nuclear-buildup-report  Accuracy counts.
Silly, desperate loser clowns.
The Federal Government and the liberals in the Dept. of Education and the teaching profession already got to the millenials from the early age of 5.  They've had the kids nearly 8 hours a day, filling their head with liberal, secular propaganda.  They are brainwashed.    So now, faced with the biggest enemy of the Catholic Church, the US education system, the Church is now asking the brainwashed youth about how the Church should move forward?  Inane stupidity.
It's all about race with you guys. What a bunch of racists. And that singular act of awarding Obama when he had barely been in office, was the most damaging act to their credibility ever. It turned their vaunted award into a joke.  How is it you don't get civiled for that "pathetic lives" crap. Respond all you want I'm not wasting another second with your childish rantings.
Idiot. They are students-they don't have day jobs.
Not exactly -  he said that many think he is "loathsome".....you downright called EFC that.     And then you decided that anyone who does not think in lockstep with Sr. Joan (and you, I guess) are without a brain.  That's not quite civil, is it?
Damn Obama- couldn't take our guns so your taking our glaciers, huh?  Does  Donald Dump know about this?
#JuggaloMarch and Trump supporters both on the march.   One is a group of people who worship an insane clown,  ...the other is a group of Juggalos
Yep that's right Mr. sexual predator Donald Trump over 3 million voting Americans voted for somebody other than you so you are the loser,!! 💩💩💩💩💩💩💨💨💨💨💨💨💨😡😡😡😡😡😡
Ugh, this guy is just the WORST. Arrogant, privileged, smug, and dumb as a stump.
Getting shit-faced drunk isn't a good idea for man or woman.  But that doesn't excuse rape.
Obama confirms again, that he is nothing but an inconsequential fool. Trump should hand him a banana and take his White House keys. No point waiting till January 20th.
what a jerk
Leah has a shortage of friends, So no-one their ear to her lends. Her life must really be crap if she resorts to an app and on this page her misery pens.
What case? The U of O will settle. They always settle under the guise that it is cheaper than to fight it and they will admit no wrong doing as usual. Pathetic..
So let me see if have this right...Alberta oil & gas bad, bad, bad.... BC oil and gas  good , good, good. HYPOCRITES
Do these folks ever stop to think that this cigarette habit is an expensive, health ruining addiction? Apparently not. You don't have to be ignorant or stupid to start smoking, but it sure helps.
The thought of Pope Francis and Herr Trump in the same place at the same time is disconcerting.  Hopefully, His Holiness will tell Trump to stop being a narcissistic, racist ignoramus.
What a bunch of hypocrites. All meat eaters no doubt, many hunters as well.  Whining about how this bison got killed before they could get their jollies off killing her and her offspring "legally." Pathetic.
But vilifying Trump is OK.  You are a hypocrite.
About fifteen years ago they brought one of those traffic experts up here to make suggestions. His big one was to take Northern Lights down to two lanes between New Seward and Minnesota. Had nice pretty drawings made up and everything.  Can you imagine what a mess that road would be if we had been dumb enough to follow through on it?
Richard Wright, I see you like your own comments. Troll on, buddy!
Any system where a "caregiver" is paid $8K/month while absent and irresponsible ... might that set up some red flags, somewhere ???!!!   A second matter - I am not familiar with the foster care system - but it is my understanding that foster parents do not retain their children for more than a year - some silly rule somewhere. Anybody clarify this ? If that is so it is another idiotic piece of bureaucracy .....  Anyway - this case is an embarrasment to our so called caring Canadian culture.
More fake bull crap coming from the left wing media. You people don't freaking get it and never will. Teflon Trump will slaughter you! And the reason it doesn't stick is because it's all Bull CRAP!..and the real Americn people KNOW IT!
agree with your co-workers because everyone needs to have the same views on everything....being an individual is now out!  Male and female alike all must shave their heads and faces, no makeup allowed, no eyeglasses, must use contact lenses.  Conform to the liberal crap everyone, so none of them are offended by anyone actually  having a BRAIN!
This case is clearly of the highest level of stupidity of political correctness.  The Supreme Court of Canada is not God!!! Their ruling could be wrong. He was terrorist not POW, even if US not using Geneva convention was wrong, that does not mean he was innocent, different issues! Yes, Canada somehow didn't do it right. But Canada letting him home and setting him free now is already the decent compensation. In my opinion, he should serve a life term for the treason. This 10.5-millim stinks and was wrong. 15 year old criminal is criminal.
Meh. Both parties gerrymander. Trying to stop it is a fool's errand.
I am no fan of the Fed NDP party but they are hardly "rabidly anti-Alberta".   They are simply deeply misguided and ignorant with respect to Pipelines and Oil production and refining (Leap Manifesto).
Someone let the alt-right trolls out.  Time to use the ignore button.
James Mason 771:  But reading ADN online especially the comments section is the perfect serum for counter-acting the TV induced stupidity.
Never once said "stupid."
Many things in this story don't add up. Stealing the Magic Bus and driving it down the Seward Highway? I can't imagine someone would think they'd get away with it. The article also said that the owner had it re-keyed so unless it was broken into someone obviously had the combo and I seriously doubt all 12 passengers would knowingly jump on a stolen bus for a joyride to Seward unless this is a case of the 13 most dumbest criminals of all time.
Bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. Sucks to be a hypocrite. And to those who would defend him, shame on you as well. Or is his, Murdoch's, and Trump's behavior the new norm? Sexually abusive and lairs? So much for demonstrating Christian values.
Whaaaaaaaat the Duck:  Send ALL ILLEGALS back.  Male, Females, Children, Chihuahuas.    Clear up jail space.  Built the WALL, Keep them OUT.............  If you are here LEGALLY,  Welcome, Obey the Laws, Have a good Life...............
I don't back ISIS, rather it is republicans who back them.  GW by igniting the middle east with his never ending wars, showed that.  He played right into their hands.  How dumb was that?  Doing it while reducing taxes was even stupider.
"...it's part of our national DNA...", then the patented, big stupid grin. Our country is being led by an absolute fool.
You want 'malignant'?  How about holding up a decapitated effigy of the President and Democrats think it's a hoot? How about producing plays where the President is assassinated and the left goes wild? How about a Democrat going to a baseball field to massacre Republicans and the Democrats...especially the scum Obama...show little outrage? And then we have Democrat women dressing up in the "C" caps and vagina suits prancing around and calling out for his assassination. MALIGNANT?  YOU are an IDIOT!
Tax the sh*t out of it. HFCS is killing the idiots who are fool Enough to consume it.
Trump is the most petty and vindictive president in my lifetime. Repulsive.
There is not a more unlikeable, tone deaf imbecile in the HOC than Stephane Dion. His ignorance is profound.
I think he's both....he's definitely ignorant.
Tragic and pathetic, and some pathetic comments by brexit supporters here. The European Union has made it possible for Western Europe to remain at peace for 70 years, probably longer than at any time in history. The pathetic aspect of this is that the British folks who have legitimate grievances have been brainwashed to blame foreigners for troubles for which their own governments are entirely responsible, as well as the class system of British society. They have kept in power for decades the very elements of British society who have no interest whatsoever in improving the conditions of the working classes and ordinary folks. Unfortunately the past few months have made it clear that the present Tory government has no clue how to deal with this situation.
THIS was censored by the civil gestapo: "Nice shooting by the educated stupid person just looking for a paycheck,er,uh, I mean trooper. I wonder how long the animal suffered because of the inaccuracy of the educated stupid person just looking for a paycheck,er,uh I mean trooper." Is it too much to ask for the civil gestapo to stifle the "happy pills" before voting on the poster's comments?
trump is delusional needs help  sad!
Bennet is a do nothing Senator along with Cory Gardner. It is their job to fund federal transportation infrastructure. And they are stupid for suggesting another toll road. The bureaucracy is not incompetent. It is the politicians who are incompetent. They want to raise taxes on the middle class. They will lie to you and say the gas taxes are supposed to pay for all of this.
Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt.   Trump's ego prevents this piece of wisdom from penetrating.
Mark Begich go stick your head in a bucket,  Alaskans aren't stupid like you, trader You as governor would be an insult to the State of Alaska residence
Trash, complete trash
Allow me to do your homework for you. The federalists tried to give Patrick Henry a congressional seat to help draft the US Constitution. Henry turned down this power stating; "I SMELL A RAT!" When he federalists produced a constitution that omitted a bill of rights we saw the rats Henry smelled.  As an antifederalist Henry bitterly opposed the federalists power grab.  "Fellow Virginians, no tyrant can touch you now. I have made sure of that. You have a bill of rights that protects you. You arm yourselves against the weak and defenseless (state government) yet expose yourself naked to the armed and powerful (fed government).  It was Henry who drafted 40 amendments in the form of a federal Bill of Rights, and in the end he won us 25 of the 40. Five alone are found in the 1st amendment. Henry was very clear on the intent of the 2nd amendment he warned us to guard as if our lives depend on it, for if the tyrants get this one they get them all.
Why is everything you Repubs don't like just silly.  This kind of thinking has been going on since Pope John Paul II connected with the GOP and told us in church to vote for Reagan and the GOP.  This mess has been going on since JPII got elected pope and his ant-communism, anti-socialism, anti-unionism  agenda came to the front.
"Disgraceful" is name calling and judgmental. And Yes, you are a troll of long standing. You were the only ONE singled out for that title, because you go around making snide remarks about people who you don't like and there are many.  Yet you exaggerate that I was very busy calling people trolls. Don't bother denying it.
Yeah, another cowardly bigot trying to rationalize.  Dime a dozen. With emphasis on cowardice.
The left will try any lie, to stop themselves from owning up for their murdering ways. If they think the people who democratically put Trump in power will lay down while the left rapes the working man, I'll be laughing my azz off, while all the crap comes down. I'll sit back and enjoy watching their fairy tale world  implodes.
If you go to that couple's FB page the young woman presents a VERY different picture and explains in detail what they have done and what they are doing. I think they thought the $$ they would get from the show would help them out a bit and didn't expect to be blindsided my Marty and Discovery.  Anything with Discovery's name on it now is dubious at best. And Marty is a buffoon who makes Alaskans look ridiculous.
The poll is garbage. I feel the building should be restored. It has history and architectural significance. The last thing you need is devouring a country of its history. Our neighbors to the south have only invested and expanded their leaders' (presidents) residence over the years. Think big, stop being petty. .
Uh huh. And if you believe this, I've got a lot of swamp land to sell you.  Sorry corrupt, Pathological Liar-In-Chief, no one but Trump Chumps believes you.
...and now those rats want their money back from the Clinton foundation.
this is stupidest thing I've ever seen.
TRUTH - What could possible be your motive for asking such a ridiculous question ? If you have an allegation make it, and knock off the innuendo.  You must be a member of ICON66's clan.
You just said it all for me, Matt. My first dividend was $300. I got the first check in the mail. Now we're vilifying Gov. Walker for withholding a windfall to pay our bills? This after no outrage over multiple special sessions that resulted in - wait for it - a big pile of expensive NOTHING! Stupid ppl suck. And we just reelect them...
As is the persistent posting of the same ridiculous comment.
So the Alaskan people can't get services they need but the oil companies get paid.   That's pretty sound logic (sarcasm). Maybe if Meyer and Chinault included the Democrats in the decision making process all along they would be done by now.   Seems to me this happened a year ago and the republicans didn't learn anything from that (except that they get to continue receiving a per deim check for each day they stay in session.  And BTW I've been a registered republican since I was able to vote.  But I call it like I see it and these so called republican leaders are idiots.
This is absurd and disgusting. "Only six King Salmon" give me a break, Chief Larson.  Now that it's dead, go and harvest it, but what an awful thing to do.
I would be happier and our country would be safer if anti-American pieces of garbage like you were in jail.
"Pam Knowles, the third woman, on the board had felt similarly too" Pam is so hypocritical. She conventionally forgets how she marginalized Director Buels and anyone else who tried to bring up issues or concerns that were not part of her agenda.
Trump is a complete and utter fraud and most of the human race understands it. Funny how Trump fans can't capitalize, punctuate, or show signs of literacy.
So Uch808,  you'd like everyone to wait until the whole "famdamily" grows up before going on any vacation to visit grandparents on the mainland??  I think you're only speaking as a selfish and frustrated traveler whose had to endure crying and whining infants on a long flight.
"They're just a bunch of selfish, whiny, angry white guys."  Just exactly like Donald Trump.
If his memory was cloudy he shouldn't have said anything. Soaring like an eagle one day and grounded like a penguin the next. I admired him and it is very sad that he went out on the limb for his stupid boss and the limb broke. You have to remember that people were hanging on his EVERY word including me and that's what bit him in the s. The Chump has the kiss of doom.
But the Donald said" We will make only american,NO GHINA"!! HYPOCRITE..
Well, thanks to the idiocy of Wynne, Ontario and Toronto in particular can kiss the current wave of new rental stock planned or in the planning stages goodbye.  It take 8 to 10 years to go from intent to develop to completion of construction.  As such, there's a shortage of housing coming down the road like Toronto has never seen before.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.  And where is the logic in taxing only foreign speculators/  There's more domestic speculators than ever before?  Tax anyone trading in real estate for anything other than principal residence. Problem solved.  The Liberals ruined the electricity market.  Hello disaster for the residential real estate market.   Oh how I wish the entire gang of them would simply evaporate.
So anybody who opposes Trump is "the Left"? What arrogance and bovine excrement! And you can speak of "sweeping generalizations" with a straight face while accusing "the Left" of "breathtaking hypocrisy"? Do you know yourself at all?
Anybody who blames Trump for Obamacare should just be sent to the mad house.  You are either trolls for the fun of it..or so famously stupid that talking to you would be a waste of clean air.
Forge ahead like the Fascist you are. I would suggest you find another country. Venezuela is probably looking.
That's exactly what I thought!  It is rather sad and pathetic that someone would have several logins just to agree with themselves.   Sad and funny at the same time don't you think?
On the contrary.  Canadians should take complete advantage and enrich themselves to benefit Canadian shareholders before the corrupt Negro criminal politicos steal all the money.
I like Trudeau, but do not give a squat what Trump thinks, in fact my cat has more common sense than Trump.
by loosing by 2.8 million votes? you shitheads are killing america
His tweet supporting the anti Trump demonstrators show what a complete airhead boy blunder really is. How stupid can you be?
Repugnants are evil and must be destroyed.
decent???? what is decent in your mind? how about 50 an hour!! then your big mac will cost 35 bucks, you ready for that?? see ignorant sheep, there is only profitable wages, that is what is decent.. nothing else
What a more on.   Do your damn job!   This guy's only ability is to take selfies with naive left-wing progs.
He's dangerous, not because he's an idiot but because he doesn't have the best interests of the US at heart but his own self interest. He's also dangerous, because some of his supporters are armed, dangerous and willing to start a violent revolt if they don't win.
Says the man who voted for and continues to support a pathological liar.  That isn't even irony.  Irony is more subtle. This is stupidity.
The absurd premise that the U.S. Constitution covers everyone on the planet even if they’ve never set foot in America is total rubbish. Only a Obama-appointed globalist lunatic would dare to foist such nonsense.
You're a troll. Telling other people that you are a troll is a public service. Get your own account, you're not the original account holder, you're a fraud.
Don't worry the entire process will be automated in a decade or less.   Darn pesky humans.
Vectum: you are a very sick person
And Canadians elected a spineless pussy that obediently does whatever the lying u.n. orders him to do!  Wake up Canada!
Well we are of course talking about Donald Trump. What's that hard to imagine? He is a stupid jerk and prone to doing stupid things.
Donald Trump is a lazy Tramp who wanted Governor Kasich to be vice-president so long as Kasich would run domestic and foreign policy.  Trump's "America First" campaign theme is ripped off from the anti-semitic campaign of Charles Lindbergh and other American Nazi sympathizers.  Donald Trump is a narcissistic, racist, incurious know-nothing and those who support him dishonor this country.
T:  Don't be so foolish.  I would merely like the details to determine what is true and what isn't.  At best this is a fluff piece, nothing new just more of the same.
Build a new $1 BILLION prison and throw all these useless homeless people in.  If Honolulu can build a $15 BILLION useless train, the State can afford a much cheaper prison.
i am sure the alt left lunatics, legendary for ignoring knowledge being the sheep they are, would be fascinated by the many articles that debunk every claim that mans carbon is doing anything bad to the climate, thus destroying the pathetic lying strategy of the climate cult lunatics,, would you like links??? here just a few , i know you will feel better. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXxHfb66ZgM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Lye5liWuZw
And you're mentally deficient
Great Movie. Go and see it. This article is daft and ridiculous.
Kinda like Jimmy Carter asking his daughter, Amy, about nuclear weapons policy...Kasich is so full of bovine excrement.
You mean something like "white power"? She probably did. The alt-right seems to have an affinity for knives this week. That's what happens when you mix meth with hate and ignorance.
Who cares about this clown or any temp ban? Real immigration reform is overdue. Stop the trash from coming.
Ignorant and uneducated. I am a human advocate as well as a a CANNABIS (use the correct word, don't show your stereotyping/ prejudice so openly) advocate. Your intelligence is lacking at best. I'd be happy to debate you and embarrass you on the lack of factual information swimming around in your confused head.
Yes, the Republicans are that stupid.
What else is new, but more lies from another corrupt Communist Leftist?  This biothc is a member of the Black Caucus, which is nothing more than a group of black Communist militants, who want to instill Communism in our country.  POTUS Trump would never disparage a military family, but this corrupt pig of a Congresswoman has shown a history of lying and hating throughout her time in Congress.
No clown, you are dead wrong. You are drawing a false distinction between wealthy and non wealthy Chinese to suit your racist narrative. Truth is you hate the Chinese because of their ethnicity. There are lots of other ethnic groups in the GVA parking their wealth because of the tremendous appeal of the region. So much so that the spineless politicians caved to public pressure and passed a FOREIGN buyer taxes to curtail their investment activity with mixed results of course because politicians are not foolish enough to kill the golden goose that fuels the BC economy.  But racist pigs like yourself endlessly repeat the same hate filled rants against one specific ethnicity, the Chinese. There is no denying their participation in the market, by the media, politicians or industry participants, yet you continue to single them out and brand them as a threat to the Canadian way of life.  You are disgusting and should be banned permanently for spewing endless hatred on a public forum.
His friend was on tv claiming this guy was only arrested because he's black. Really? We don't want criminals coming to our state, no matter what color they are. And we don't want to hear any "because he's black" crap.
It shouldn't be rocket science, but it would seem that one of the very few talents this mob have is finding complexity in the mundane. The mind boggles at the sheer stupidity.
You people are rude and ignorant and should take your hate to a counselor.
I'll give one step further...... He was an idiot and maybe loosing his faculties from aging.
' More Traitors Tied To Exxon and Russia Back Traitorous Trump's Treasonous Tillerson..  Republicans who support Donald Trump's nomination of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state also have some sort of connection to either Exxon and/or Russia. .  James Baker, secretary of state under George H.W. Bush, supportsTillerson,    Baker is a partner at a the law firm Baker Botts, which represents both Exxon and Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft. .  Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates work for the consulting firm Rice Hadley Gates, Exxon's lobbying arm. .  500 billion is a pretty good payday for traitors,   … and Trump and Putin fall into collusion to make it happen. .
Forget the manini ban or the clown judge, real immigration reform is needed. Stop the trash from coming
and idiots think it's a bad thing Russia and the US work together to crush Islamic state american paranoia (and the Globe's) is truly frightening
The ADN is left-wing garbage as usual .
It's pathetic that Trump garnered just over 50% of the votes of Alaskans. Nationally he has no mandate. His ego knows no checks and bounds. Resistance reminds us of our own values and integrity.
If I protest the seal hunt I don't buy sealskin products. If I protest the slaughtering of animals I don't eat meat. Coastal Protectors need to walk the talk to have credibility. Immediately ban the use of petroleum products and their derivatives in the cities, towns and coastal waters along the BC coast. Otherwise you are hypocrites!
Hypocrisy has zero to do with it.  You break the law, things like this will usually rear it's ugly head sooner or later.  I think the main reason you aren't a republican is because you're not very bright.
You can't simply make "tweaks" to the ACA and not create a worse mess. It is far too complicated and nitpicking for that. It needs to be repealed and replaced.  Now, here's a great idea -- why not replace it with the free market. Let people decide for themselves whether they need insurance and negotiate with companies (or doctors) on how much they want to pay?  Oh, right, because then government wouldn't be involved and we all know we the people are smart enough to vote for who will be our master for the next four years, but too stupid to make intensely personal decisions like health care and where we want to spend our money.
I see due to supporting the loser your pom poms never came out of the closet...Hahahahah That makes you a loser.
Woohoo; you're way out there buddy. You DO understand that's it's Trumpski--Putin's pet poodle--that is wanting to increase our nuclear arsenal? No, I can see that you don't.  You need help. Your brain isn't wired correctly.
The nasty left are tolerant of no one at anytime that don't fall into their warped fantasy.
Turtle Man isn't clueless.  He's just a liar - a liar who has now gone down in flames. _______ Let me be somebody I admire  Let me be that muscle down the street  Stick another turtle on the fire  Guys like me are mad for turtle meat   -Leonard Cohen
Or is it that the City thinks that we're all fools all of the time?
Dermot, why don't you mention Dick Cheney's Dubai based Haliburton, which enjoys many billions of 8a contracts with the government but white trash like democrat Claire McCaskill never mention them when she is attacking Native entities over 8a
So you have only negative headlines for trump , unless he praises our fearless clown of a leader.
" .... given that I had no political agenda ... " Please. Don't treat your readers like idiots. Anyone who has seen the paper in or been on line in the last three years knows better.
Only an idiot follows the food babe. She couldn't science a tray of ice cubes in Alaska in the dead of winter. Virtually everything she has ever claimed has been debunked.  Remember her article about the airlines where she was complaining that they didn't use pure oxygen in the cabins? She had to delete that one it was so embarrassing for her. If you search you can still find archives of that gem.  She knowns nothing of science, agriculture, beer making, or anything - she's a fraudster who capitalizes on the ignorance of her followers.
Why spend a quarter million on a video surveilance system?  The idiot filters would clog in the first 30 seconds of operation.  Vote for open carry in the Legi lairs.....
Those early stupid selfish penalties could have easily cost us the game.  The line needs some discipline and needs to execute better.   We could have padded our lead early but blew it multiple times.  It was really disappointing to see them play like that.  I'm just glad we got out there with the win...shape up!
Birds of the same feather flock together. One corrupt liar supporting another corrupt liar.
"Trump is a Machiavellian type, which means that there is probably some dark purpose behind even his dumbest moves. This so called clown did defeat the best strategy the Dems had to offer, and they're pretty tricky their own selves. He also conned almost half of America to vote for him. Is it possible that Trump isn't as stupid as his opponents would want to believe?" Is this the part that got my comment "rejected"?
Cory, some ppl have kids who died for that Anthem and Flag. You're going down next election you unpatriotic fool.
Poor John Kasich who is struggling to find a voice someone will listen to and failing spectacularly - RINO loser
Sheckles....that is very anti-Semitic You know I attend Synagogue with 3/4 of ADN's reporters, and the owner. You should show more respect to us Jews, and stop using Hebrew currency as a derogatory synonym. You must be a troll from /r thedonald....that is borderline hate speech show more appreciation for the culture and religion that brings you and your community news on a daily basis!!!
Drugs make you dumb
I think this belongs in the Onion or Beaverton section OMG I cracked up laughing - so many people are going to take this seriously - idiot drivers - idiot cyclists - idiot pedestrians = people are idiots period
The faithful are dons base simply because they disregard facts. If your message is delusion based on lies, where else would you go when that's what you practice. These people feel threatened since all facts demonstrate that they are trapped into believing a false narrative and they are too cowardly to admit it. it.
At least you and the Nazis have the same ideas. Congratulations, you are human scum.
You don't know?    You're going to act like you don't know why this pardon is different.  The pardon and why it's different is the topic of several days worth of national debate and you're going to pretend you can't decipher what has been discussed?  It must be hard for you to be so very misinformed and unaware,   …bumbling from misconception to misapprehension.  Sucks to be you, eh?
Carter? Nonsense. That would be Bush Jr.. Obama? Considering the worst contrived do nothing congress in American history, and all the racial hatred that still exists, he'll always get a high rating. The Republican party is now the American Fascist Party. But just like all their other lies, they will never admit to it. Their sheep are vocally loud and mentally weak.
This is the only advice whazzup has ever had, regardless of market conditions. Which is why he is the resident clown in real estate-related boards. No logic, just housing cult propaganda.
Wow....the morons in the comment section are out in force on this one.....
The fence around the White House is being increased to 14 feet high to keep out those evil illegals, with no objection from Obama or from Linda.  And if Linda's property is fenced, it would expose her liberal hypocrisy.  "Mr Trump, build that wall."  Let's get this done.
President Nixon was taken down by the media, with the help of an FBI informant. These two leftist/ Commies had the story delivered to them. They knew that Mcgovern was receiving money from Cuba and Hanoi, which they mention in All The Presidents Men, their book. The country was engulfed in conflict fueled by the Vietnam War and all the terrorism in the US. The Weather Underground, Black Panthers, etc. were trying to collapse the nation and this goon was Right On with them. This POS is a traitor!
Stop being politically correct. Since those assholes from hurricane Katrina showed up, Anchorage has gone to hell. What do you expect from people who act like barbarians. No moral values. Irredeemable. Nothing to salvage.  It's fascinating to see native Alaskans embrace and enable the lifestyles of these savages, especially the females of Alaska. Theres nothing admirable about these thugs. You can tell a pig by the company they keep. Lay down with dogs you get fleas. Just keeping it real. Police officers need to put leashes around those dogs necks. I just said what needed to be said.
Memo to the Globe's HR Dept.  Stop wasting money on American washout's and their terrible op-eds. Not sure what you paid this guy, or what Kendzior gets paid but it's clearly too much.  Also Trump is the president of America, we have our own populist idiot saying stupid stuff, maybe write about him
Utterly stupid, impulsive and contemptible on the part of Renée Smith-Valade and Air Canada. Why didn't she pony up and make the apology personally instead of trotting out a spokesperson? Simply mind-boggling.   Renée rightly earns the bonehead-of-the-year award.  I look forward to hearing she's been issued her walking papers toute suite -- with no 'golden handshake'.
big sissy
the educated right defeating the alt left lunatics
Where's my apology for having to put up with this nonsense?!
It doesn't get any dumber than this. An unelected bunch of unaccountable bureaucrats is America's only hope? Only if you're so blinded by progressive ideology you can't imagine the knock on the door in the middle of the night will eventually happen at YOUR house, you contemptible twit.
You, Sir are one of the most ignorant people on the planet!  I would guess that your IQ is right up there with Donald tRump at around 80.  I was going to give you a paragraph by paragraph rebuttal to everything you said, but decided you weren't worth my time.  Consequently you only earn my distain...
Success is a painful lonely process.  You are right.  Most people are not willing to do what it takes to be great.  No a surprise.  What is not good is the belief amongst liberals that we should all get the same outcome...pain free.  You are profoundly stupid!
So your point was to get arrested.  For what?  So people can see what "good actors" you all are?  Guess none of you bothered to read up on how many rail cars transporting crude were going to be removed from the tracks, which have a higher risk of spill than pipelines, not to mention that the train engines, which spew diesel exhaust wouldn't be doing that either.  You sure showed us with your intellect of stopping a pipeline while promoting crude transportation via rail.  Way to get arrested and show your ignorance!
I myself am pro-choice, just anti-liberal stupidity.
You didn't hear well respected Republican strategists hammering tRump's debate incompetency.  All tRump came prepared to do was showcase his headline porn topics that Hillary buried.  Why do you think tRump's kids stood passively next to their limos and didn't dare try to get into the limos without tRump's nod?  PATHETIC.
Somebody tell this Swede we were all better off when the population was 2.5b rather than 7b. What an assertion this guy makes. Three quick things to purge my mind and body of today's globalized assault- 1) The Vikings were scum 2) The Swedes have no heart in hockey 3) Swedish meatballs are made from something I can't pronounce.   None of this matters because there is no such thing as Swedish culture anymore however, they are in good company. Canada 150!!
Traitorous and cowardly rightists are perfectly fine with cops killing people for no reason. Now we're back on an even keel.
It really isn't about Trump, is it?  The world has moved on.  It is time to let American garbage stew in its own rot.
Were they bused in? Just curious, since it was obviously staged and pathetic.
No I think what he meant was that some crap stays crap.
klastri, your party is not doing any better so stop acting like the pompous fool that you are.
A "proven racist?" Where are you getting that silliness from?
oh silly loser, the people decide and such will be giving the right a huge majority by a land slide..  they will have the time to fix all the damage the left has done with out bs
Liberal progressive democrats are the pathetic masses of whom Stalin had often referred to as useful idiots.   The indoctrination is complete, free speech is dead with the democrats.  If you're right of lgbtq communists transgenders, then you're a NAZI...
The guy is promoting violence and lawlessness. He's a progressive lunatic.
Re-read the last paragraph, Laddy.  However, with all of the traffic in and out of that entrance to the park, it's almost impossible to find the jerk(s) who did this.  True as*holes.
Nanos polls are worthless....guess who pays for them???
Be honest for once in your life Acosta.  That was a monumental smack down and you looked really foolish.  Start wearing a Maxine Waters mask to the briefing cause that's what you've become.
A pig with lipstick is still a pig!  Once again the Republics are putting forth another plan with no time to determine what is will or will not cover.  Only fools and politicians buy such products.
NFL what a bunch of anti-american haters.  Sorry this country and our hard earned dollars made you so rich that you feel like you have to shove our faces in your BS protest.  Guess what?  I like cops, our veterans, our country, our forefathers, our way of life better than I like any of you losers.  Go F yourself
Genius, people who buy cocaine and heroin by the ton have no trouble having their supplier throw a few cases of guns in the shipment.   You can buy a fully-automatic AK platform weapon in the ME, Africa, and much of South Asia and South America for a hundred bucks or less.  Brand name handguns are hard to get, but there are lots of serviceable copies out there.   There is relatively little flow of legally purchased weapons to criminals.   Most guns in the hands of criminals were illegally purchased by straw men, stolen, or smuggled.   Of course, not a few were put in the hands of criminals by the Obama Administration in their unbelievably stupid "Fast and Furious" gun-running operation.   No legitimate bad guy would be caught dead with a US legal semi-automatic weapon.   A US legal AK starts at about $800 and is semi-auto, the smuggled one is cheaper and is full-auto; crooks are generally stupid, but not that stupid.
I'm mortgage free as well.  Have been since 2011 and if home prices collapse I'm well positioned financially to take advantage of the opportunity as I did in 1995.  My current home will become a rental for income in retirement and I'll downsize for myself.  However, I do care about what happens to the economy.  Those hoping for a housing collapse are idiots and are probably too young or stupid to know better.
The Liberal Left Party machine will be all over you now that their shill pollster has cooked up some numbers to brainwash the stupids into thinking they want to spend 6 billion on a new palace for the camp counselor and his wife.  He doesn't need protection, who would hassle the guy? We feel sorry for the fool.   The real issue is who some schmuck from his fundraising scam who has never built a house let alone a mansion will get the consulting gig to oversee the reconstruction. as the costs explode into billions as the center of the Earth has moved and a new pammelgation unit had to be instaled with 19 skyhooks to hold Ottawa up  You just know where this will go.   Palace gate news at 6pm as the chinese guy from FungSwei China who doesn't speak English and who gave $5.000 at a recent fundraiser gets the gig with no RFP>
Re: "her father values her opinions and counsel"  Not per the myriad examples explained in this column he doesn't.  You're a much better liar than T-rump is, though. (See: " The First Lady in 1992, publicly declared herself the co-president".)
They didn't focus on self-actualization and they have crap jobs as a result? They are very social and don't care about their "crappy" job prospects as they are doing "fairly well" anyway? Sounds like you raised two self-centered, uncaring and non-contributing millennials. Congratulations!
This is the same monster who threatened to Jail his political opponent.
I hope so! Chicken sh— coward!
Bobby Hammons you unbelievable scumbag. If anyone has drug money they are protecting that's Jeffrey Keebler Elf Leprechaun Sessions. He is a puppet of Big Pharma and Tobacco.
I sound like ...? You're ridiculous. You've made inferences about my character based on a couple of comments?  How about this? You're too scared to post here using your real name so you hide behind an anonymous moniker while you spew your stupidity while you work at the FCC. Come on chicken, post with your real name ... since you work at the FCC you can then tell us all the real story.  Few if any 21 year olds are capable of making nothing but well informed good decisions. A person's frontal lobes (the area of the brain responsible for "judgement") isn't fully developed until around the age of 25.   The state is responsible for those in it's custody. End of story. Discharging someone from your custody into the street isn't living up to that responsibility.
All hail to her majesty the baby killer queen and a daughter of Mengele. What a horrible human being.
This argument is getting old.  "If you don't like everything I like then leave!"  How about you provide some meaningful input on how to fix the most expensive healthcare system in the world.  Jackass.
It's time for a mental eval because Trump dare point out your violent Marxist friends are damnable scum?
They are stupid. They were manipulated with lies and with hatred. That's undeniable.  Trump branded his supporters like pimps do with harlots, turning them into mindless bots who lack the intelligence to disagree with anything he says or does. The latest rant is a small example of his vile character. Others were worse, including mocking a handicapped reporter.   Like Einstein said, two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity. And he wasn't sure about the universe.  Don't believe it? Read the comments of Trump supporters.
Another bobble head to stand and nod approving all the nonsense that spues out of cabinet ministers mouth during scrums
I used to use the horns powered by canned air.  Not worth breaking my phone over one of those thieves.  Now a scammer gets to deal with my mouth.  I say much more than thief and liar.
Its a mind alternating narcotic that has no place in decent human society.   The only people who think it does are those who are either addicted to it or selling it to people that were stupid enough to get addicted to it.
' Attempting to normalize Trump is idiotic.  He's a con man and a buffoon.  Nothing else, it's who he is, it's what he is.  .
Gregor is a real cuck's cuck.
Why all the hype before you passed judgement on the document. We were expecting the "big" reveal you were going to make..   But once more you fell right on your butt.   However, there are still a lot of people who think you're a credible media person, though I have no understanding why.  Maybe they are as inept as you.
Did you GRAB his hand from his side ? Because that would, indeed, be assault (or possibly battery - the differences are subtle and only really important to lawyers). But if you held out your hand, and he reached out to shake it, then he DID consent to that contact.  Consent doesn't have to be verbal. If you claim non-verbal consent, the court will judge on testimony whether it was reasonable to interpret the actions of the person as consent. If he pulled his hand back, and you grabbed toward it-  you'd be guilty. If he shook yours - you're fine.  Much as - if you grab a woman and kiss her, that's usually sexual assault. If you stop a few centimeters away, and wait to see if you she comes in and kisses you back - then it is consensual. You tried to commit a reductio et absurdium fallacy, but all you managed to do is be silly. If you intended to show that the law is silly, then you failed, because it's not as your silly example is entirely legal.
Many millions of us are as sick as McLame because of you in the media constantly bringing him up.  I haven't wanted to hear his egotistical crap for years, but I bet some damn media hack will be standing by his deathbed with a defibrillator hoping to get one last obnoxious quote to print.  What has he accomplished, other than his egocentric image making and being quote fodder for lazy vacuous reporters?
What a sham! Northern Dynasty will now have 30 more months to hold the folks of Alaska hostage with a fools gold false permit. Murkowski, Sullivan and Young should be summarily sent packing.
Liberalism is a mental disorder.
repubs are clueless.   Since when is fixing a wording error in a law that is already on the books "an attack on the Constitution itself"?  This pathetic republican should be shown the door next year.  We need workers in the state capitol, not a lazy whiner(R).
' Where did all those Trumpeteers go? .  The Trump fan base has gone into hiding,  …unless it's news they can race bait, or show off their xenophobia. .

The demo's started this fiasco and tried to dump it on the other party when it went off all the cliffs. It's dying a slow death and in order to save it some painful decisions are needed.. well, the dems sure as hell don't want to do that and haven't. They talk the good talk but certainly don't walk it. Someone has to fix this mess, or it's off the rails in another year. Costs have tripled since its inception and it's not available as more pull out of the markets. At minimum, now that the ball is rolling, the demos will have to participate in the senate or explain why to their idiots back home that sent them. Re pubs will need to to work across that divide too.  It's not about Young, focus on the real problem.
trump is finished.  He has zero credibility at this point.  He is a blatant and confirmed LIAR. He is worse than a used car salesman in Las Vegas.  NO ONE TRUSTS trump.  He is KAPUT !!!
Hickel was a big, but practical thinker. Gravel was and is a con artist whose big ideas always smack of the long grift. Those of us who lived in Alaska when he was Senator know who Mike Gravel is and that why we showed him the door.
lol, hillary the murderer lives in your head rent free.  Why should I support and idiot that tweets about a nearly dead issue while 3.4 million Americans suffered?
Trump exhibits yet another symptom of the narcissistic sociopath - - kicking people when they're already down.  Trump is in severe need of personal counseling by professionals.
If Koelsch starts, we are doomed.  Sorry but her kill percentage is pathetic.  Who will start in the middle?
Bob Karman, bulky trash cannot contribute to a politician's campaign fund or shower them with perks.  Hence, Rail gets funded and the garbage sits in plain sight decaying.  Even Richard Daly, arguably one of the most corrupt mayors in modern times, realized that you have to pick up the garbage without fail.
What felony criminal got a lic for selling/growing pot. Names please. I am curious because that would be incredibly stupid with FBI all over town. Is it a politician? Lol.
Why do you Globe sleazebags tack on a worthless hidden Ibbitson column on the end of this roundup?  Is trickery the only way you can get people to read his crrap.
No. No, he's not a smart guy. And neither is Jack from Chapel Hill. And neither are you.  http://chapelboro.com/news/national/chapel-hill-carrboro-mayors-sign-letter-president-trump-supporting-daca  Postscript: It's "than", not "then".
Drive thru's are a more efficient use of space.  This is why the private sector uses them, and wants them. Hales works for the government.  He is in charge of an entity that loses money every year, and goes deeper in debt every year.  He hates the private sector, and has no clue how to be successful. I'm not going to say that Hales is a clueless moron, but if you say it I won't argue.
"Bringing up Bill Clinton just shows how laughable you republicans are."  You say that I, a Republican, am "laughable" for bringing up Bill Clinton's affairs and lies as if the behavior of an impeached president is inconsequential.  At 73 years of age, I still have a brain that works just fine and also a very long memory.  Just before calling me laughable for not ignoring history, you claim that credible, quoted sources are "old wives tales" and, in a less than brilliant diversion, focus on Trump's tax returns.  There is no law that says a POTUS has to reveal his tax returns.  It may be a tradition--or past-presidents may have been bullied into revealing their taxes--but there is no obligation for Trump to reveal anything about his taxes.  If he has done something illegal or hasn't paid them or paid enough, the Dems in the IRS would be on him in a nanosecond.  BTW, I'm thrilled to learn that Hillary is not POTUS.  That "news" which you hate to tell me is a constant comfort to me.
La La Land, you mean Hollywood? How many award shows are there? Me Me Me look at Me. These people are all whores when it comes to money and awards.
Ah yes,  another delicious moment.   Trump takes a phone call from a female leader of a free nation and a bunch of snowflake losers get their panties in a wad. Its these little head fake moves that President Trump will continue to keep the idiots busy crying while we get to the serious business of righting the ship. They had their chance and fudged the bucket. Keep giving them something on a weekly basis to make them wet the bed so they don't get in the way to much. It has worked for over a year with no sign of them catching on so no need to change it up.
Just drop this guy in he. That's all he deserves. We sooooooo need an expeditious eithanization program for these anti social scum.
Those who bought a year or two ago are underwater after you factor in closing costs on the purchase and sale of your home.  Your comment tells me how financially illiterate you are and that's the biggest problem with Canadians these days.
They all suck.
Sore loser eh
What simplistic nonsense.
Barnhart sounds like a fool with his nonsenseical analgogies.
Berkeley......says it all. Dumb ass.
Why I must I have to explain things to people? Obamacare is bankrupting healthcare providers and individuals. I am so sick of people thinking that they are entitled to things. You're not. Obamacare was created as step one in the overall plan to create single payer healthcare and if you think that it's a good idea to have the government run your healthcare, then all I can say is that you're an idiot. Single payer is a danger to the elderly and if that is not enough reason to oppose it, then once again, you're an idiot.
typo....Last sentence above should read: "Oy, French-less O'Leary's a political  O'LOSER!"
There is little doubt that the Liberals are reversing themselves on their own guidelines of conduct in this instance to the frustration of their own supporters; however, the argument being made by the Globe and the Conservatives goes way beyond that to comments such as 'pay to play', 'immoral', 'backroom dealings' etc.  Like you using 'Liberal paid hacks', 'too blind and stupid' and 'sock puppets' the invective renders the arguments banal..
Really?  I remember in the not too distant past, The Incompetent One whining about how Fox was treating him, because they would not go along with treating him with kid gloves (lest they be labeled "Racist" for being critical of him).  What, you think we didn't notice?  You bunch of Hypocrites.
When even hard-core Conservatives  like Will and Krauthammer can see what an irresponsible jerk Trump is, we know the presidency is in serious  trouble.
You are insinuating that people that don't agree with your opinion are morons?  I personally don't care how a particular reporter votes.  They are individual citizens with the right to keep their voting record private.  If you have a problem with fairness in reporting on a particular story, then join the discussion.  If you are here to declare how smart you are and how stupid everyone else is, I suggest you find a different forum.
Perhaps millions will cross into Canada as they did in Germany.Joe trudeau will be on vacation somewhere. He does not care about Canada.Wishy washy Canadians. trudeau makes me sick
Oh, a cross country tour - sounds ever so nice.  What a pompous twit he is !
The woman, or so I'm told she is a female, gets more hideous with each lie.
Lots of republicans on suicide watch today. The republican party as they knew it is no more.  Just a group of racist, misogynist, bigoted dim bulbs is all that's left.
Why don't you take a matrix pill called reality while you question my maturity fool.. Your wrong in every faction of your statement. Oh wait lol, you have no factual statement while I refer people to CL housing. You must be one of those creating hell for the country cause.. Let me guess, spoiled hillside greenie with no facts but simple arrogance as you ride hubbies coat tails trying desperately to feel important as you pop 5 different meds to get through tomorrow
Where is Fish and Game. Calling in this situation should be against the law and being that close is very dangerous, irresponsible and since it's a park, should also be against the law. A fine should be in order and people should understand this is not a zoo. I believe this is where the term idiots comes from.
If there was EVER a chance that Hillary would've been indicted, Rhyner, it would've happened by now.  Excuse me, what's Hillary in the indictment crosshairs for, Rhyner, it's been so long that moss is growing under your feet and the moisture has warped your brain.
... Cheetolini supporters are wonderful, I love how you remove ANY DOUBT what complete racist homophobic xenophobic morons you ALL are ... yet ... consider yourselves Christians.  80% of Cheetolini supporters consider themselves Christians.  'christians' is the reality ... super fakey, horrible human beings.  Waste of human flesh.  When you die the earth becomes a better place.  Jesus was a person of color.  Suck on it.
If they're idiots who need rescuing from that trek, yes.
Good -- I don't have much interest in visiting petrofascist, Banana Republics who elect moronic p***y grabbers for President.  The feeling is mutual then.
This guy was never funny. I always wondered why anyone thought he was. Way to ruin someone else's event by vomiting your political ideology all over them. Idiot.
you lefties were happy to live off alberta proping you up for years in equalization payments but now nothing for the west, typical of the idiot liberals.. as for diversity, well see idiot, that comes from the supply and demand in a free market not some government program ,
"Get these clowns away from your children ..."  Oh, Okay.  So...no Bozo costumes either, I guess...
No biases, thank you, just a realist.  Maybe he is biased toward Jews.  The fact is, he is ignorant and has a destructive agenda.  Can you imagine the rest of the world putting sanctions on us for destruction of the atmosphere using the Trump policies?
Trump is turning out to be every bit the sociopath he appeared to be during the campaign.  Lawsuits against him and against this needless, vicious attack on the healthcare of millions of Americans (including a lot of his hapless voters, who don't understand how Trump has attacked them) will be filed by the dozen, starting tomorrow.  Trump is not a king, despite his delusion that he is.  Trump must be removed from office as soon as possible.  Tillerson is right - Trump is an f-ing moron.
These clowns are basically subcontractors, who said they would finish the job in 90 days. So treat as such, hit them with the standard "Liquidated Damage Penalty Accessment" $10,000 a day for every day they go over, each one of them.....
this spokeswoman is a moron . plain and simple. I don t know how Air Canada can operate hiring employees like this. however maybe this reflects management of Air Canada if it does they should be ashamed of themselves. I  doubt if any of them would have the guts to do what are vets have done in order for them to enjoy there nice life. disgusting actually.
Don't give any of these clowns six years.
LOL your rhetoric is just as disrespectful as the group of guys that cant seem to find their feet or hearts during the anthem. Your obviously uninformed or uneducated if you think kneeling during the anthem is not disrespectful. I could care less about the % of people kneeling. The NFL is condoning it and try to cram it down the viewers throats. Most people tune in to the games to escape for a few hours . Now were forced to see the disrespect to a country that we all know isn't perfect but we love. The only idiots are the ones that know what I am saying is true but don't care because they would rather watch a bunch of overpaid crybabys then to stand for something important.
The President is a violent psychotic.  Anyone with a functioning brain should be able to see by now that he is profoundly mentally ill.
Trump is almost certainly the most irreligious President in U.S. history. Although Jefferson and several other signers of the Declaration of Independence and drafters of the Constitution such as Ben Franklin were what would now be termed agnostics, for the most part they held principled, ethical, and well-informed intellectual beliefs. To put Trump on their level is laughable. Anything Trump can't steal, eat, bully or  f*** is either worthless or a threat in his eyes.  What's less clear is what the evangelicals think they're getting out of this bargain. But then Jesus did have a lot to say on the topic of religious hypocrites, didn't he?
hey lunatic it was ALREADY past that point, take a hike loser
Trudumb hasn't got a chance against Trump.....Trudumb is too stupid!
" Nearly half of your nation voted for Donald Trump and you arrogantly dismiss them as gullible."  They voted for a sexist, racist, lying demagogue and the are supposed to be proud of it?
I love trashing that lunatic. Wait for it, wait for it...
Gardner is a paid liar for the insurance industry.  Every one of their proposals over those last "seven years" has been a repeal with nothing there or replacing anything.  He should be ashamed but these right wingers are incapable of shame.
Baltimore is in Maryland, a foreign country, so real Americans couldn't care less what those apes do.
They basically smeared a good man so Kurt caldwelt would be your mayor. This is a complete travesty and very upsetting. But as usual no one will speak out about it bunch of donkeys.
Cultcha?  Okay squirt, now you're getting ridiculous.
why don't you follow your own pathetic advice?
Give the EU, those lazy blood suckers what they deserve. A nuke to put an end to all socialism, world wide. Enough  of those lazy people world wide breeding like sewer rats and expecting someone else to look after them.
Well, that comment sucked.
Maybe. Trump was right.   Idiots on both sides.
Yes the shooting of Michael Brown which was 100% legitimate. BLM leapt to conclusions and are too dumb and arrogant to take it back.
They also didn't act like morons.
hskinut>  Funny, I still don't hear any laughing from you!!!!  You still hanging out with the your loser buddies, huh????  Well, being brainwashed or brain dead that you are,  what you say is expected, so carry on with all the lies and innuendos that you so often speak.  Ha, ha, ha!!!!
Imbecilic rantings and ravings of Raul Grijalva of Arizona (a staunch Sanders-Socialist supporter) cares NOT for the citizens of this state, but rather for maintaining his position within State Government.   A few of his gems of brilliancy:   Determined the border-wall would prohibit the migration of birds ...yes, birds ...who FLY over walls;  Proclaimed a boycott AGAINST Tucson AZ (his beloved city), during the state's SB 1070 immigration bill, with the following details:  "We're asking organizations, civic, religious, labor, Latino, organizations of color to refrain from using Arizona as a convention site, to refrain from spending their dollars in the state of Arizona..." - further elaborating to keep-out Superbowls, concerts and all events beneficial to Tucson; Rounding out his stupidity - called for the boycott of "Arizona Ice Tea" - which BTW is based in NewYork - NOT Arizona - in protest to immigration policies. Simplified:  Grijalva is a lunatic in a powerful local govt seat.
The term 'transgender' is a sick joke. It is a mental disorder that should be treated as such. When you have children that claim to have this transgender illness there is no doubt it something that needs to be addressed before they make the mistakes so many have with becoming an adult.
Here's a bit of reality, the right to religious liberty, like many other rights is not absolute. This is especially true when you're using religion as a pretext to discriminate others. There's no other two ways about it. If your religion insists on discriminating other human beings, don't be a hypocrite and expect the law to condone it!
pack up illegal scum, everyone going bye bye. take the meth and heroin with you, pigs! All forks pigs you are going too, easy to find you here in small town. Ice and BP have you in their sights.
The city has tried to and has already worked with these owners in the past but they do not keep up their end of the deal. This is not a case of stupid government, smart commentator.  They continue to use this property as a bargaining chip to attempt to get tax breaks for other projects like tearing down the 4th Avenue Theater just as they already have with 188 Northern Lights. The city has already agreed to waive all fees for material disposal if they tear down the building.
The truth is no Canadians know Canadian values because there are not any outside of tired cliches and corrupt politicians babbling self-interest nonsense!
Maybe these wankers wrote the fake intelligence report.  Pravin, Van Loggerinberg, Lackay et al should go for the jugular. Sue Tom Moyane, and subpoena the KPMG people as well as Belinda the honeypot to give evidence under oath and cross examination. Retain a really savage prosecutorial legal team led by Gerrie Nell. Nail the wankers.   They will have the support of HSF, FUL, OUTA and thousands of crowd funders. Hammer Moyane to a pulp and toast the remains.
Either you have to be incredibly rich, incredibly stupid or Vladimir Putin to support Trump at this point.
I'm sick of these black anti-American idiots constantly attacking the President of our country because their leftist ideology lost and is being buried by Americans as too far left  and not in the best interest of the country...  Blacks have overplayed their racist card and their victimhood - its pure leftist anti-Americanism now.....
I shake my head every time I see someone in the grocery store with case upon case of bottled water in their cart. What a waste of money. A fool and his/her money are soon parted.
More cr@p.  These same people would probably b1tch and moan if they found out instead that Disney was thinking about maybe doing a pacific thing but decided not to; they'd be all "where's our depiction?!" This is the thanks Disney gets - a bunch of BMWs (b1tches, maoning and whining) - for trying to showcase more than morthwestern European folktales. "...problematic when...Disney, for example...sells the dark skin of...say, Pacific Islanders..while the...group gets very little in return..." What was stopping the group from doing its own selling yesterday??!! No one cared to try until somebody else makes some money, then they get all in line with their BMWs expecting a handout. For what? For simple just being, existing. I exist, therefore you should pay me because you are making money off of the fact I exist(ed). Sad, sad, sad state of entitlement, delicate offended sentiments, and reactionary Leftism. No industriousness here, only tearing down of others' effort. Sad. Go away, Ka'ili.
These gun nuts are really pussies at heart.  They always have to reach for their heat because without their "protection" they are afraid of everything.  He shoots an unarmed man in the back over taking down fliers, and this is "self-defense"?  In what universe except the alternate reality in which the gun nuts live?
He is a sawed off berkely idiot with little man syndrome. Just the facts
I live in Denver.  People like you are a big part of the problem.
Exactly...such poor reporting. Pathetic really, no wonder everyone in Eugene and Springfield get their news on line.  Way to go Jack.
The Dr's I golf with on the weekend are very clear that the only people hurt by these stupid tax moves are the "average" joe, the ones that Trudeau is "helping". Hours will be cut, staff laid off and no new patients will be seen, some will even be cut off. Guys like me know Dr's personally or can afford to go to the US for treatment, for the rest of the voting public, they get screwed.  The best thing to happen, is to have joe public not get a Dr. or have to wait months longer to get care, then see what our fearless politicians do.
“Trump is obviously insane”?  Arf a mo, Mate!  Ain’t you the perfumed prognosticator who last year was DEAD CERT Trump would never BUT NEVER be elected President?  Why should anyone EVER take ANYTHING you blurt out seriously, eh there Sportin Blood?  Dropping trou as you so often do in these fora makes for an amusing spectacle. Not to put too fine a point on the obvious, but your creds are in shreds, Skippy.
Talk is cheap.  But it doesn't matter. Vlad got the incompetent fool he wanted. America will be even further in debt with a few more wars on our hands by the time Trump is out in 2020.
We should put a ban on mainland visitors who want to live here and for sending people to our beautiful state.  These guys are more dangerous then the Muslims.  I'm calling the President.
hey ignorant one,, business owners will gladly pay the highest wages thier industy can afford to reduce turnover (see they unlike you understand those costs) but have to pay wage limits to ensure they make a profit, thats what they are in business for in the first place, THIER livelyhoods, not employees,, funny your heart doesnt bleed for the thousands of min wage people that will lose thier jobs over this
It is sad to see anyone lose it like this.  I wonder what the causal factors were.  Of course many don't care and are content to say he is pond scum and deserves whatever he gets.
this is from a man whose only fame comes from being a sock puppet for an FBI beaurocrat
Don't comment on CANADA TRUMP!  We have no need for you!  We ROCK   you are a disgrace!
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahha  Oh that felt good.  Go away .........Donna is calling you for dinner.  Journalism is getting to be like going to a pot luck or an all you can stuff in your gullet free for all.    One (such as  me) can only comment on what's out there at the moment.  Correct?  Whenever I chose to comment, I do so after researching various news sources (sorry, never FOX/CNN) and digesting those and commenting.  Now.  What I mean by 'news sources' is not sitting in front of the boob tube and listening to idiots TELL ME what their OPINIONS are or what the 3 (that's THREE) billionaires who own ALL of mainstream media want them to think, feel and say.     I watch C-span when I can.  I use the Intercept.  Propublica.  The Hill.  Democracy Now to name a few.  Now.  You've not chosen to link where you've gotten your facts.  I'm sorry you didn't as I'd love to check out the links to study those as well.
No  He won a majority ............ and I bet you voted for the biggest loser
Politicians on both side say stupid things. Look at the bright side, you get 8 more years out of your "tRump" joke. You should be happy.
Wow.....the Bush peoples are fake?  Darn......I wanted to leave from Maine and go to Alaska so I could rub dirt on myself and climb trees, and get a deal on a 5 K WWII mine sweeper for delivering a crappy front end of a 1935 buick made into a desk.  Everyone knows that these things are not in the lower 48.   I have now changed my mind and want to homestead in VA so I can just crap wherever I feel like, with the pigs, and have some dude with a cowboy hat wearing a dress shirt tell me how and where to crap in an outhouse I really don't need (being a stupid city slicker...arf arf).
Obstruction, collusion, stupidity.  too bad, drumpf did everything else right, lol
well, its big oil and the dirty bastards club buying the ladies and booze now...
Bernstein is a malignant dip$hit.
Very Sad for us as the people who died  were Disciplined Christians and were in our Church congregation................  Killed because of a persons "STUPID" Habit, Cigarettes...........DISCUSSTING............
It's so stupid that some media is saying that as long as Trump doesn't talk about how long or short he hangs, he's won the debate.  That may be Republicans' belief, but I doubt seriously that's the way most American voters believe.  Go Hillary, and p**** whip him.
Good lord who voted for this giant clown . Trudeau can go jump off a bridge.
Nope.  Just genuine laughter at inane, outrageous and unbelievable stupidity and contradictions.  They were very worthy of laughter.  And Hillary! too!  and I am now having fun with you because you are completely ridiculost and don't know when to stop, so it is easy. I do, however, know when to stop and now is that time.  Gotta go out and appreciate America and interact with real Americans, even conservatives, who have something intelligent to offer, even if I disagree, because they, unlike you, love this country too.
Wow what a shocker!   I think Judge Watson is finally seeing the light, and doesn't want to embarrass himself any more than he has by making dumb rulings that the Supreme Court will slam down.
Ridiculous.  The next thing you know other religions in Quebec will want their own cemeteries like  Jewish and Roman Catholic faiths... oh wait.
Trump is more capable of being president than Trudeau is of being PM. Trump is buttering Justin up and the little boy laps it up like ice cream.  i would be sceptical when Trump tells an idiot what a great job he is doing.
Trudeau is a buffoon as was his father . His wife isn't fairing too well either. And they are breeding.
The NFL, shoddy player's union, "Weak Link" Roger Goodell, all deserved the slap down Trump gave them. About time someone called out these losers. . All the whiny players failing to show respect, their minions, would do well to stay inside the team locker room until the game is ready to go. Then with tail between their legs, they can come out. . Sad to say so many full diaper, whiny, snot nosed, legend in their own mind wannabee players in the NFL.
Now that Medicaid is dead, who will pay the elderly's medical bills in the Little Sisters of the Poor Hospitals? Either the nuns will have to throw them out or come to the people in the pews who have also lost their medical care -- we won't have the money to pay either.   That's the price the sisters will pay for allowing the Koch Brothers and Carl Anderson to use them in that ridiculous birth control lawsuit  -- all the GOP wanted was to kill Medical Care for the poor and elderly, as well as embarrass the black president -- so much of this has been racial.  Why  align with the rich narcissists who never attend Church except to receive awards for their selfishness and self-righteousness? So sad ...
Obama is petulant sore looser. Now that he is on his way out, he plays tough guy with Israel and Russia. He had eight years and waits until now. What a coward.
Yeah, Trump doesn't want the jurors to hear the racist garbage that came out if his mouth before and during his campaign. To the extent any if it is relevant to the issues, I hope the judges denies his lawyers requests.
Trump stayed where he's always been, which is a jerk.
Now this is funny!  Of course Hillary never lied. She landed under snipe fire in Bosnia right? Never deleted those emails that were classified? I am glad Trump won! Hillary was the most corrupt person to ever run for the office. Drain the swamp! Hillary went down the drain on Nov 8th and on the 20th so will Obama.
and the nut job left winger proves that the left are the trash of this place, insulting a successful owner of a network with gutter talk insults.. the typical left wing trash you are.
These anti-flag unAmerican ungrateful disrespectful pricks should be deported.
I love the fact that these morons describe themselves as experienced hikers. Experienced in hiking the flat rugged terrain of Atlanta? By no means do I consider myself an experienced hiker or an expert outdoorsmen however it never fails that every year I show up some self proclaimed expert from the 48 that thinks venturing into the wilderness of Alaska is an easy task.
That was Kauai. She got caught and was charged in Federal court. Stupid beach.
The liberal censoring of comments in here by the leftstream media is precisely the reason why Donald Trump is so popular.  They'll never catch on, bless their little minds.
Don Young is some statuary that's overdue for removal.
Vintage Trump SOP.  Make an idiotic, provocative statement (or present an idiotic, provocative tax 'plan' in this case) and watch the talking heads go berserk bashing, defending, and debating it.  Meanwhile, all eyes are turned away from his incredibly inept performance and collusion with Russia.   When will the media ever learn?  Answer: Never.  Thus it is incumbent upon all of us to discriminate between real issues and Trump alt-issues.
Al Franken, who stole the election to become a clown senator, now attacks religion.  This fool can't understand the Constitution, and neither does any other of the Marxist left.
Fort Mac is burnt to a crisp and still burning IN DECEMBER all the way to Saskatchewan and the idiots focus on a pipeline in bc that WILL NOT BE BUILT. Messed up.
Are we 'Great Again' yet...??? Our Attorney General appears to be a huge liar...probably criminally so...and that's not 'Great'...
Pretty ignorant, even for you.
Idiots.
yes the ignorant and bigotted left have lied and run into power, thank god as the tide is turning the fair minded sensible right wing is about to spank down notely and wynne then justin soon enough
How about you kiss my ass? I stand by my earlier comment.
Articles like this are one sided and demeaning. Get your facts  right before you spew nonsense such as this. The Globe should be ashamed of themselves. Click bait and nothing but useless words from an incompetent  columnist.
Scratch a Obama critic and Racism become evident. Obama is terrorist? Where is the proof? Obama is a Christian.  Pro debt. Obama wasn't allowed by the racist republicans to present a budget to Congress that they would consider. It is republicans who drove the debt higher. and so on.... Total nonsense! Your head is up your derriere.
LOL. Trump kicked media butt in this news conference.  He strays off topic frequently, but when he answers directly, especially pointing out the media hypocrites, he is dead on.
As something of a conservative, I'll say that he's an ignorant d-bag that should just stick to his brand of boorish, loud mouth, money-grubbing and not be allowed anywhere near public policy.
Hey Sally suck it up. You lost get over it loser. Wow where do you Limpys come from?
carbon taxes will kill canadian exports. Junior has beaten trump to stupid town
Your hateful bigoted racist misogynistic homophobic statements don't work anymore.   People don't feelmshamed anymore by being called these names. Especially by liberals.   Liberals are too stupid to,realize the new insulting thing to be called is a liberal.
Your a wimp  Grow a spine All muslims come from a religion with bad start  Get realistic about Islamic terrorist and understand that the leader of Islam is the descendent of an Egyptian slave and banished by Abraham  Mohammad committed a violent action on average every 6 week for the last 8 years of life Wonderful I'll take Jesus anytime
Lisa Murkowski voted lock step with the Trump administration, for Jeff Sessions.  Sessions is a racist.  Lisa backed him.  She is such a hypocrite.
Didn't read any of the article but the picture makes me wanna say that Bill is toast. He'll be primary-ed out next november.  He wasn't elected to schmooze with Gramnisty and the other RINO's.. The people of Louisiana are fed up with his crap, he was voted in to replace Mary Landreiu and isn't much better. As we coonasses in Louisiana say...He's aha gone pacon! MAGA
'Fox clowns only deal in inuendo"...If that's the case, what does MSNBC, NBC, CNN, and the rest deal in?
Absolutely ridiculous! Didn't Anchorage taxpayers buy a military tank?
Cigarette smoking was replaced by all kinds of drugs from prescription to illegal street drugs in all income brackets, so the ignorant and stupid part stayed, only the type of bad habit changed.
Get rid of this clown or we'll be paying for it for the next 150 years.
Sorry, THIS is the most ignorant thing I've read today.
Oh this is rich.  Trump helps the coal industry and the left is outraged.  Now Trump turns down the coal industry and the left is outraged.  What a textbook example of how Trump Derangement Syndrome has manifested among the sore losing hypocrites.  Too funny.
.  If Putin didn't successfully engineer Trump's victory then it is not from his lack of trying or from wanting that to be the outcome.  The point is that he tried to engineer Trump's victory.  And the overarching question is why.  Why would a corrupt dictator in control of the world's second largest nuclear arsenal and a badly faltering economy want Donald Trump to achieve the Presidency over Hilary Clinton?  His rational is what the historians will be most compelled by.  Trump admires most the brutal tyrants of the world - Putin, Duterte, Kim, Sisi, Saddam.  Trump is a weak, egocentric, anti-intellectual, grifter who is standing helpless on the bridge of the ship as it slowly founders, unable to make the course corrections needed to keep it moving forward.  You may not like it, your op-ed piece in the Globe not withstanding, but that is the very unfortunate reality that the western democracies find themselves in.  Kudos to Mr. Saunders for shining the harsh light of reality on it.  .
Bersntein, keep doubling down on stupid. It is the nature of modern Democrats. TV sound bites and MSM have been surpassed with something called social networks. In other words, there is a new kid in town and it ain't you or your ilk.
' Trump is nothing but a con man and a buffoon.
Did you support the pedophile and rapist BC? Do you now support the wife who went after the victims? Of course you do and did, but you are a willing participant in the dem. leaders and main stream medias goal of electing who they have choose. Yes, the puppets in the dem. party are fools, fools who don't even realize how successfully they are being used. Do you have any idea what is going on in the world? Do you realize Russia, knowing that HRC will lead the two nations into war, do not want her in charge? She is a disaster, she is a war monger and she will further destabilize the world. But don't worry about that, you have your instructions to just focus on allegations so continue being a good and loyal puppet of the dem. leaders and the media, the world be d#$@%$! Our children and grandchildren's future be d%^$$#! You can feel good about following your orders and focusing on what your instructed to. Yes, the dem. voters are fools.
... stupid people are a fact of life, just look at who they elected President.
haha..he played the foolish clownish, overmatched Trumpster.
your communist father must be proud that you are so aligned with the communist murderers in Cuba.
Maybe Depper should stick to his day job, being a douchbag.
you are a troll
Coward.
The ignorance that is Trump, and there are America's who actually want him to be President.  God help us all.
You crack me up. Trump lies pathologically EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. and you castigate the media for being "dishonest." Trump commits obstruction of justice and Republicans blame Comey for not outing him earlier.    You guys are a bunch of clowns.   You can't fix stupid.
It is time to impeach this idiot judge. He has no authority to overrule the supreme court.
We have the capital in JuKnow and another where the majority of the people are because the majority of us Alaskans are just plain stupid and allow this to happen. Why else would we have two capitals?
She has no proof its just more stupid comments.
I would just mute this troll.
Easy to gauge President Trump's successes. The better he does the more the whiners complain.  They are having fits. I'm loving it. Go Trump.
Wake up dipshit the drugs go right back onto the streets in the hands of informants and police.  Cops are not our friends, theyre the real criminals.  You people really are ignorant.
FBI is criminally infected with traitors and needs a purge. That simple. Mueller needs to be put in prison along with Comey, both are working for HRC and are liars.
Trump and the Republicans control the government. This 35% increase is on them. They failed to "repeal and replace". Trump is a liar and a fraud. He promises you the moon and fails to deliver.
Hillary Rodham Clinton is as crooked as a dog's hind leg just like her womanizer husband whose street name is  "Slick Willie".
Strange.   Old and should, .....really, know better. Your comments are meant to be insulting, and they are. Typical low life Liberal...   Always the same,,, Deflect, insults, and lies, perhaps i should add..... stupidity.  Right now, Canada is in trouble financially. People like you have caused this..
Another Liberal, overhyped and over paid.  He lies as easy as he breathes.  If he cared about the USA he would tell the media to report truth and facts and not repeat rumors and false news.  He is not worthy of the 1st amendment.  Ignore the poor ASS.
Perhaps, the Donald should tell them that they are ugly and their mothers dress them funny.
He just did tell you.   He said: "Having a leader who is pretty but stupid gets old real fast."  It is also my experience that having a leader who is pretty but stupid gets old real fast.
I hope he is mad and in a mood to talk!!  Hire him now CNN!
Punch those fat commies on the face. And all the commie collusion traitors that we have in the repugnant party.
She didn't so get over it. Stupid is forever with the (D).
Holland's option could end up costing as much as $23 million with incentives. Funny how the Rockies didn't mention those pricey incentives when telling us what a genius Bridich is for signing Holland for $6 million - which ended up costing $14 million. The Rockies should be praying for Holland to leave - they cannot afford a closer for $23 million, especially not one with a 3.61 era and 3 and 6 record.   The Rocks should be looking to move Bridich's other expensive mistake, Ian Desmond. Ironically the Rockies could probably re-sign Cargo, the guy they expected to replace with Desmond, for far less than Desmond is costing them. Despite whining about being a small market team the Rockies make a lot of stupid payroll mistakes - as shown by the $45 million (or 30%) of their payroll that was "dead money." The Yankees and Dodgers can afford stupid, the Rocks cannot.   The Rockies #1 need remains what it was last year - a couple of decent starting pitchers.
This article is way too good for a crappy nanny state rag like the Denver Post. Now the countdown clock starts on when they'll delete my comment like they did to a slew of user comments on a viciously stupid anti ecig Op Ed a few months ago.
um   ......  "satire" - the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.
You can fix stupid.  You incentivize people like you to live in a  containment zone.  In your case it is Seattle.
Great outfit, great  personnel and equipment,  perfect use of taxes.  Probably a stupid kid, but anybody can wind up looking stupid in quick water.
F you trump supporters!  Disgusting people, disgusting!!
Eat a big fat fatty stupid leftards...
Yeah.  I liked him at first, but this inability to cover TEs is ridiculous.  By halftime of the Giants game, there should have been an adjustment, and by the next week, a plan in place.  Gronk is going to shred these guys if they don't figure this out.
Not difficult for anyone I guess to capture this imbecile.
Bernstein is an arse-kissing Democrat "resistance" nutjob. He's no more a journalist than Hillary is a paragon of virtue or Bernie Sanders is a freedom-loving defender of Capitalism and property rights. Bernstein's just another jack-a## DemoRAT, pretending to have legitimacy and objectivity while all of us in fly-over country pee our pants in laughter at the thought.
It's high time to get rid of Trudeau and his corrupt, unqualified ship of fools.
Asking a portfolio manager for housing advice is like asking a dentist for automotive advice.   DUMB.
This column is trash.
Does Globe and Mail deliberately spread FakeNews to make idiots of their readers? ..this property was sold a couple months ago.  https://www.thestar.com/business/2017/03/31/torontos-trump-tower-sells-for-298m.html
The Donald is such a first class clown.  Incapable of showing any empathy, he is just a showman, an entertainer who is incapable of feeling people's pain.
cia scum,you need to be educated about truth,losabumma,gimp'
What a buffoon. The simple math says if you had rolled up your sleeves and focused on improving the immigration vetting the original planned 90 day ban would be past the halfway point. All we are seeing is an intimidation process, dictator, bully at work. Nice to see the USA courts stand up to this.
Believe nothing the city tells you about rail. Nothing. The shibai has been in from the start. At this point, if you are a person who believes anything that Capt. Kirk the Space Cadet tells you about rail, you must be dumber than a doorknob. Rail. You wanted it. You got it. It's all lies people. Suckers.
"They have no appreciation for the Constitution, much less the unwritten norms of liberal democracy."  Trump is a fascist pig. He needs to be impeached as quickly as possible. Impeach Trump now.
Your comment doesn't make sense, given that the only troll here are Liberal.
The Trudeau Liberals are waiting for permission from Trump, they sound like Trump's lap dog.
What a disaster.  Could these guys be any more incompetent?  The Conservative Party is embarrassing beyond belief.  It seems that many of them are following in the steps of Harper and Del Mastro.  Time for another RCMP investigation.
This is unbelievable. If the man hadn't resisted, it wouldn't have been a problem. The police stayed remarkably calm.  Of COURSE the police felt threatened and like the situation could turn dangerous. The majority of the people in that crowd/mob had no idea what was going on.  It was simply angry, easily incited people who are biased against the police and have no ability to think rationally. If I had seen this incident? I would have been frightened - not because of the police, but because of the ridiculous mob.  Anyone can cry out "police brutality" - and this? Was not it. They did not injure the man they were trying to arrest until he had been resisting for minutes, and they needed to quickly diffuse an escalating situation. What a completely unnecessary incident caused by angry, belligerent, crass, foolish individuals. I can't believe this happened in Eugene.
You are probably right, but we are never going to get rid of presidential fools. What about all the 750+ serious charges of corruption against him? Shouldn't he step down until he has cleared himself? Time to get rid of him.
LOL  Or the stands with the crazy parent.   The wives comment was over the top, for sure, though.   Used to coach youth basketball for the Y.  One of the coaches I worked with was an absolute jerk to the kids.  The kids weren't having fun and did terrible.  Next coach was a true coach for kids, and the team did great.  We even got to play during half time of a Nuggets game.  The kids were so funny running out on to the court...most of them just looking around amazed at what they were seeing.  I think there was one score in about 3 minutes of play.  Classic!
Only thing this moron considers sustainable is tax cuts to the rich.
wiliki, you're the biggest liar here.  You said rail was already paid for and rail pays for itself.  The current rail construction costs will not be the final tally.  That's just the current lowball guess that the mayor is passing out now.   Until the next mistake or shortfall occurs.    Rail was sold to the public for 2.7 billion.  The current cost including contingency fund is nearly four times that.  Fire Caldwell, fire wiliki
Marilyn Mosby is not a [public prosecutor], she is a radical black activist who has shown herself just to be another hate filled progressive liberal.
Except Jr. is too stupid to stick to trade issues.  He wants to talk about indigenous rights and gender equality.  We're going to be laughed out of the room.
Soooo....you spew "trash talk" and spread the Big Lies about Trump, but can't confirm with Real, Actual verbatim Quotes....Just as I suspected.  One of the most disgusting aspects of intellectual dishonesty is when Anyone of ‘Any stripe’ lets their ideology blind them to the truth.  And NO...I would Not refute anything you’d post...as long as they are irrefutable  verbatim quotes from more than one reliable source.
The fundies I know think of the Vatican and Catholicism as a pedophile ring.
Leave it to Codere to waste money on a silly mural of one of the most depressing songsters of the 19 th and 20 th century . It is no wonder young people commit suicide after listening to that musician for awhile he leaves one without hope after hearing his work
' Hey mister headline writer!    Hey, ...Yeah, ...you. Listen up. . Trump's cabinet appointees aren't confronting ethical questions, …they're trying to avoid them and/or ignore all questions of ethical concerns. . It's what they do. They're crooks and grifters. They have no mores, they have no ethics. . That's why Trump appointed them, they're just as morally bankrupt and crooked as Trump is. .  1 Reaction Delete
So, except for being an 'interrupter', he was a nice guy ? I mean, you know, apart from being a low-life scumbag misogynistic jerkwad and all of that.
Talking about the cops kicking in your door, stealing your herb, forfeiting your land and putting you in jail.  All the while they are selling the extra herb they keep from folks they bust.  Drug war is a lie and a hypocrisy
Although Trump was correct that everyone who participated in the violence is at fault, his lack of calling out the racists was telling.  Sadly ironic that the white supremacists wore MAGA hats and the idiot who drove that Challenger into the crowd was a nazi sympathizer.  Yep....these are the morons who helped elect Trump.
Move on you poor loser. Trump is here to stay so if you want Trump Gone how bout winning at the ballot box instead of trying to use the courts
I can't believe that this lightweight incompetent is the Prime Minister of Canada.  I can't believe that Canadians chose style over substance.  I suppose the alternatives were not great.  I am actually hoping O'Leary comes along and holds this kid's feet to the fire.
Evil, racist Trump...sigh!
Got you.  If he's white and/or Christian he's just a disturbed individual who went off the rails.  If he's Muslim he's a terrorist.
really, this old fool has never said one nice thing about a republican that I can remember
And this is why the liberals are considered by many to be blatant hypocrites. They immediately scream their outrage when a right leaning group steps over the line however when groups like  BLM (black lies murder) and Antifa starts and participates in violence all we hear are crickets. Using the left criteria that would mean the Democrats support these terrorist groups and the violence they commit.
"....“Now we’re all going to sit together and try to come up with something really spectacular,” he said. “It’s a very, very complex and difficult task, something I know quite a bit about.”..."   Well apparently our great businessman and negotiator knows nothing about planning and business plans.  Hey Mr. Investor...I'd like millions from you.  Then I'm going to come up with something really spectacular....   That's Trump's fantasy world.  D.C. sickens me.  Thanks, big party voters...you morons....
And I'd add an H word for Meyer, and it's hypocrite.
How about all the bullying and arrogance from Mr Unger and his pathetic Our Oregon group?
Appalled by Brexit? Who? What are you smoking. The majority voted fool. Any sane person would be running from the EU like the majority did. You people on the left are so self righteous you don;t even know you are wrong?? You are wrong  Trump is at record popularity  Stop watching Clinton News or reading Globalism and Marxism. (Its an analogy it'll tell us how bright you are)
Yeah, they want the tax breaks to remodel the theatre into a mall. Gross.
You are getting free medical care as an ex-Muni employee.  Mooching off the taxpayers. Hypocrite!
How stupid can you be? WE USE HYDRO POWER, Taxies here are HYBRID, the City has electric car charging stations in parks/beaches and city buildings. People walk and bike here, many have hybrid electric cars and houses heated BY WATER POWER, stop your lying  - the walk here is that you do not come here with your explosive oil while you currently have over 500 oil spills/leaks in alberta RIGHT NOW that you haven't cleaned up, plus a FIRE from oil continuing non-stop for months.
How does she respond to recent reports man made climate change is total hogwash?  Climate Barbie she shall be forever. If perhaps she wasn't as useless as a doll she'd have a better name.
McElroy: Go to Mexico and be a Bishop down there. You sicken me.
You are right. For a party that created a big pile of crap the Dem's sure seem reluctant to try to fix it.  They own the ACA!
"Different"? Meaning ..........that the MSM might start doing some fact checking? Stop citing anonymous sources whose "facts" are rank speculation {or wishful thinking}? Removing the beam from their own eye? Acknowledging their Trump derangement syndrome? Poor, irrelevant Carl;  he's like the sixty year old former college football player who comes to the frat house at homecoming and can't stop talking about his glory days. Just pathetic.
I can't wait to see all these gun-loving Elmer Fudds joining together in mortal panic when the national cess actually hits the fan and they think their pea shooters will have any effect other than thinning out their own ranks as they shoot themselves. a regulated militia of ignorant right wingers in combat against their bogeyman? HAHAHAHA!
You're basing your accusation on lip reading of a covertly filmed and dishonestly edited partisan video?  Do you read lips?  As nearly as I can tell, you can't even read reasonably written posts.  Your accusation is 100% dishonest.  You yourself, and your family, no doubt have benefitted medically from fetal tissue research.  You are a hypocrite.
hehehe.  I am torn on the comment you are referencing and thus haven't "reacted" to it.  While the guy did do something understandable (not taking BS from corporate jerk-dom), to call him a "hero" is a joke.    The guy has a history of being a belligerent fraudster (including multiple felony **convictions** for fraud relating to drug dealing oxy) so it is hard to say if he was standing up for his rights or just being a stereotypical "but I'm a doctor" arrogant jerk himself.
Then make big cuts.  Is the mayor of Toronto an idiot? Rob ford part 2.
Moore is a lunatic. Here are his views on evolution.From the Washington Post: "There is no such thing as evolution. Species might adapt to their environment, but that has nothing to do with the origins of life described in the Bible. That we came from a snake? No, I don’t believe that.”
The blind and ignorant leading the blind and ignorant.  CONgress creates this nothing group to provide more cover for their absolute failure to do their own jobs.  Everything would be fixed with one massive audit of past, present, and future expenditures of the trillions of dollars already in Defense Department budgets.  Until that occurs all the rest is just the usual smoke and mirrors for never-ending massive increases for the Military Industrial Complex and the Privatized Military no longer under any civilian control and with no real justification..
When evidence needs to be wiped out, businesses close or change hands.   Pathetic.
Please do.  I hope your answer isn't to live as slaves under the rule of an armed aggressor nation.  Ask Greece and Italy how "the rediculously inaccurate assertion that socialism will bankrupt a country" may not be so ridiculous.
You are a world class idiot.
Hopefully the County negotiating team holds their ground and doesn’t give in to theses ridiculous demands.
You know nothing.  How odd that some approve of your ignorance.
If Trump cured cancer you'd complain that he's putting oncologists out of work....your anti-trump opinions are a joke and you're clearly a single-minded troll based on your name alone....
Nope.  Not going to bite on that whiff by you and the brainwashed snowflakes.  Nice try!   Temp, you are a nice guy, You get it.  Don't let them get to you.   :))  Trump has better and FAR more important things to do with NKorea than to worry about their language gymnastics when the ridiculous snowflakes and racists are throwing their hate-filled crybaby tantrums.  He said it just right, without engaging the snowflakes any further.    Seen any Russians out there?  Neither have we.  LOL!
West Ops,  Podesta IS registered as a foreign agent, you moron. Look even if it he wasn't two wrongs don't make a right. Trump fans attempt to distract from an investigation by calling it a witch hunt is unethical unfair and just plain stupid. I'm so sick of ill informed and unfair Trump posters garbage. Instead of attacking the media that Trump himself watches religiously, why don't you do you homework and think more and post less.  Trump now wants to build the Mexican wall from solar panels.. Who are you following dude? The media conservative and liberal alike holds politicians to account for the things that they say. Trump doesn't like them because he lies like a wet rug.
All you can comment is this garbage? And you're a practicing Catholic? I've been part of the Catholic community since I was baptized over 50 yrs ago. " just flag all the alt-reich commentators". Yea, as if that isn't calling the kettle black.
Munoz is an idiot cum laude. Just because he skated into his CEO position doesn't mean he is qualified or understand how customers are money.  No customers no money and PR will make you or ruin you.  No sense of how to run a customer oriented business. United better get their stuff together or they won't be flying the skies after lawsuits get done. Much less anyone wanting to fly with them.
More like a malignant media, thank you very much.  You and your accomplices are sickening and insulting.
Stupid place for a gun shop in the first place! And I don't think a thousand bucks is enough for somebody to squeal. Now all those guns are on our streets. A very simple heist. Practically deserved!
and the stupidity of the haters continues, this as usual is nothing but made up rage based on absolutely nothing once again !!,, ,, you will be forced yet again to eat crow!!
I am tired of cowards. Cory Gardener is "studying" it because he doesn't have the balls to tell people that he , of course, intends to vote for it. He needs to man up and take a public stand,if he is not craven.
Cory WILL vote for repeal. He was at Mitch's right side with his patented stupid grin when they announced they weren't done yet.
It is like Tom Vu used to say, "What is the matter with you? You too stupid to make money, come to my seminar. I show you how poor boat person make lots of money." That was over twenty years ago.
Halloween: A free-for-all for bigots and ignoramuses everywhere!
Get the handcuffs ready.  No one believes for a moment that these sovereignty activists are for a second going to respect the Board's decision do you? Hypocrites, that use the system for their cause, and then will reject the same system when it doesn't go their way.  A little thing called the U.S. Constitution got in their way.
You're really nasty piece of work.  It seems to me you hate people.
Really? You can't "wait" for that to happen? You clearly have no understanding of what transgendered people go through to make a stupid comment like that.
You sound a lot like the Chinp the immigration attorney himself, take a look at all this clown's posts folks
Must be confusing it with the other up and comer Covfefe. Moron.
Reagan emptied the asylums,now nra republicans are arming the former inmates.The nra gold and gun cult God welcomes its terrorist and mentally ill worshipers.
you've not shown a lick of responsibility, common sense, empathy, or intelligence in a single word you've spewed on these pages. muzzle up already if crap is all you got.
Stupid comment of the day. You are an apologist, and part of the reason this crap keeps happening. "StopIslamaphobia" my ass......a bit more "Islamaphobia" is sorely needed in this world.
Trump and his racist friends are the enemy and everyone should treat them as such.  We will win again, just as we won in WW2.  Good people are no longer going to tolerate this blight on our society.
No dummass. They are laughing at YOU.
I know of a nasty broad who faked two rape stories to get attention and then giggled when the cops talked to the dudes. Pathetic little thing she was i heard she moved out near big lake. Watch out dudes.
It's those darn radicalized Presbyterians!
So, now that he has big D.C. home and his big money socialite friends he is good to sell out anyone.  Whore for the system.  Nixon would not kiss his a$$ and Trump won't either.  Maybe he will go to far and this time he will be the one that goes to jail.... push your luck.
It's like I've been saying all along, Republicans are the dumbest minority group on the planet.
Hmm. Let's see now. The less educated supported the Conservatives while they were in power while the more educated supported Dion and Ignatieff, Taliban Jack, and angry Tom. Jack and Angry capturing 30% of the vote while the other two captured support from the mid teens to the low 20's. And in a surprising turn around 39.5% of Canadians supported Trudeau who was the least qualified candidate in Canadian history and whose profound intelligence has been well disguised. The moral of Larry's story is either intelligent voters do not vote, or they support appalling/dumb leaders.
What is the point of discussing it ....? You posted a (ridiculous) link to a ENB D/E of 1.17.... I say it is 3.0 (BMO source) . We are not even on the same page :):)
All of you white folk #trump supporters have the audacity to make comments and judge and you don't have your facts straight. Let's keep it real....you're upset because a black woman #OBAMA is in charge and running things and you don't like it.....wait.....are any of you black.....thought so.....carry on.....    Take off your WHITE hoods, reveal yourselves, know the facts before spewing your ignorance and feces about the internet. Don't you have a rally to attend?  #trump #kkk or something????  Shall we meet for coffee and chit chat?  Let's go.......I'm in!!!!!
Go to hell, Bernstein, and take a whole lot of worthless media personalities with you.
You can say anything you want, but if it is silly, people may make fun of you.
It's true, I'm a banker and I see this all the time and it gives me great comfort to see these communist idiots get taken advantage of and go BK
Dougie Chin looking like a fool again. SCOTUS
Obama has done nothing useful in 8 years and is going to really go out looking like a fool with some of the sour puss actions he is taking in the last few months. If they have something that might resemble actual proof, then present it. Throwing out diplomats based on rumors is really dumb and a bad precedent. Then there was the vote on the israeli settlements at the UN. The Chinese, Russians, and numerous other hackers have stolen billions of dollars of technology information and have hacked nearly every government agency, military and business operation in the US (and Canadastan too). Why not get upset about this and do something during last 8 years? Instead he is grumpy about Hillary losing election and having Trump reverse all his stupid policies. American voters voted in Trump. Putin did not cast a ballot. Get over it. Get him out of the White House. Get him out!
and yet the daily many many insulting attackes on trump but never hillary, the left wing shilling is pathetic at this rag
Shades of losers trying to dig evil gold on Trump but only coming up with fools gold! lol
Rochdale - you odious troll.  The stuff that comes out of your rear has more substance than what comes out of your mouth.
What is it you find so appealing standing on street corners begging without dignity to get out of your obligation to work and support yourself? Is it that you accept the fact you are a dead end dead beat loser who is only qualified to scrub dishes and toilets, and since you're never going to do better than a ran down trailer in a park, leeching off others is justified because it's not your fault you were born to dig ditches? Or is it reliving the glory days of leeching off of Grateful Dead concerts living out a me and you and a dog named boo fantasy?
You can't really mean this.  Trump fails at everything he tries.  His administration is a complete disaster.  He's signed law to change post office names, and executive orders that have been immediately stayed in court.  He's an imbecile with the vocabulary of a 12 year-old.  That's substance to you?  WOW!
Be kind of stupid to dislike ones own comments wouldn't it?  Besides, nobody cares but you.
You should learn something before commenting.  Maybe that is why you use an alias because you sound like an idiot.  "Grand Chief Stewart Phillip is the President of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs"
http://samuel-warde.com/2016/10/trump-said-deeply-troubled-teens-best-bed-2004-howard-stern-interview/?  His own words compell me to believe these women. Just watch his interviews on Howard Stern. He's a pig.
exposure to idiot politicians, CBC and the Toronto Star might factor into the equation
mandatory 20 yrs!! lots of pokie in da oki.  that is gonna wipe that stupid smirk off his face, good luck oki, try stay away from the pokie men of halawa or fed pen or wherever you end up.
Denial is not doing you any favor or deconstructing the obvious. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott is a coward with a gun. He was the most picked on pussy in high school and now he is a tough guy with a gun. So scared. Run reporters................
get some help you ignorant nut job
crap, mainland people are stupid and unworthy.  we need locals leading locals.
I've never seen such a corrupt bunch of poor losers......! Losers....!! Ha !!
That's such a ridiculous comment ...... If you have cancelled your subscription, how come you are still reading this newspaper? Grow up!
Yep. Stupid law. One of many.  Encourages armed idiots with an imperfect understanding of the law to use guns, in this case p anywhere a vehicle can conceivably be: Amusement parks, parades, shopping centers, day care, you name, huge potential for injury and death.  Trumpian in scope and capacity for harm.
What the Emmys reflect is the taste of the voters who work in the TV industry. Not all will be familiar with nominated series on FX, National Geographic or PBS. But you can bet they all have access to Netflix and all the networks.  This paragraph says it all: the  US TV industry produces mostly crap. Sure it's intended for the generally uneducated US public but the sad thing is that it's produced by equally uneducated and ignorant people.
Prosperity Gospel?  Is that why I often mention the cross? detachment? gift of self? kenosis.  You may want that shoe to fit, but I can tell you it doesn't.   I hold the government responsible for securing our country and borders, and I pay them a lot each year to perform basic duties of the government before they spend money on goofy sociology research.
Everyone knows fat boy had a heavy hand in this. He kills family, countrymen and probably anyone if he had a chance.
It is accomplishing something. A lot of the NFL fans are now being exposed to the problem instead of constantly ignoring it. It sucks and I hate it as well, but sometimes ugly things have to happen to get people to listen.
What's even more ridiculous is that a minority of voters put an alt-right, anti-American excuse for a man in the Oval Office.
Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.
Sadly & unfortunately, stupidity in this family was taught form the top down. They say Hispanics are so family oriented --- can't prove it from this boneheaded stupidity & neglect to not have a 7-year old child belted in? Now we are all left to feel sorry for these folks and their losses which were all preventable by simply obeying the law. Too bad these folks are so ethically and morally challenged to allow their babies to die by such violence, all so avoidable! There is no limit to such ignorance.
once an idiot always an idiot
well everything he has done so far is for the american taxpayer. He has got to get that debt under control or there won't be any money for any programs.  the ignorant buffoons before him have caused a terrible mess.
Nope I'm not a Ken. But that's really not going to convince you lunatics.   As for you Petrus, I'll get this in before it is deleted:  You are a vile, very little man. The absolute definition of a bully who is dumb as a box of rocks, can't fight his own battles, make a cogniscent argument and who appears to have the mental age of a five-year-old.  I have tried to engage you in debate only to be called names. Then you recruited your little buddies to help because you are unable to stand up for yourself. In short, what is the point of you?   Oh and you don't recognize sarcasm either.
And Dlamini is supposedly Chairwoman of the ANC women's league.  Just shows how morally rotten and corrupt she is.
Excellent post.  Please post more often.  One can only stand so much partisan crap on this site.
I am disgusted with the verdict Traitor Bergdahl received, he deserved what  Staff Sergeant Clayton Bowen, 29, of San Antonio, Texas Private 1st Class Morris Walker, 23, of Chapel Hill, N.C. Staff Sergeant Kurt Curtiss, 27, of Murray, Utah 2nd Lieutenant Darryn Andrews, 34, of Dallas, Texas Staff Sergeant Michael Murphrey, 25, of Snyder, Texas Private 1st Class Matthew Martinek, 20, of DeKalb, Ill.  received for doing their duty searching for this treasonous asshole and that is DEATH!  Please consider making this gofundme page go viral.  http://bit.ly/2yumJhG
You rarely have anything substantive to say. I'm laughing, too, but at you. The FM lies constantly, and seems to pay little price. You want gullible fools to insist there's no difference.
Because he tells stupid people what they want to hear.
And in the end, everyone of these city Council imbeciles will be reelected.  Hard to keep up, is that 90-year-old woman running again? If She is, I will bet the the farm she'll be reelected. ReMember who installed the city manager
He killed his own shipmates acting like an idiot, then gave up tactical information to the enemy that cost more American lives.
Yeah, it's amazing to see so many uninformed, ignorant, divided-by-tribalism-that-is-the-Democratik-Party, Americans who forget that they are Amercians and only think of themselves as Hawaiians, spout off about somehow connecting the illegality of the overthrow (which is true and I admit) into some modern day grievance they supposedly imaging they have with the broader America.  They resent America taking over??? Does he also regret Kamehameha I for taking over?! If he is truly a native Hawaiian, and he and his line is not from (that side of the) Big Island, then he should be equally - nay, MORE - incensed about K I taking over his Maui and his Oahu and His Kauai. Right? Where is all that animus? How come we never hear about Oahu Hawaiians pi55y about Big Island hawaiians taking over? About Jpn's bombing us? But we hear a lot about hating America (which is themselves today, btw).  Ign'ant. Ign'ant fools. Pick-n-choose who is "bad", who to hate, and who's fault everything is. Lame.
Trump brand is toxic. It stands for intolerance, divisiveness, greed as well as stupidity.  Who wants to frequent a place that attracts controversy or even danger.
This is the price we pay for having an intellectual and moral cretin in the White House.
They just dont understand putting America first.  They are all commies who hate the USA.  Bastards one and all!!!!!
This schmuck is stealing from the taxpayers Resign or be imprisoned for fraud
He's right.  She's crazier than Hooter Brown, but one hell of leader & politician.
This is the exact way to contain these Chinese bullies at bay. US design to patrol the south China sea is indeed a welcoming step. Chinese will be harpooed in SCS now. 😂 Well done America 👍 👍
The Clark government are some of the worst scumbags in Canada, and B.C. is a society in a state of collapse.  Even Louisiana is a better place.
Demboski is an embarrassment to Alaskans everywhere. I'm sorry that you had to deal with such blatant bigotry and prejudice, Mr. Jones. Don't let people like Demboski run you out of Alaska. The people of Anchorage have already emphatically rejected her once, it's time to do it again.   To Ms. Demboski: You are contributing nothing worthwhile to the political and cultural landscape of Alaska. Didn't getting rejected by the people of Anchorage teach you that your brand of nonsense is not welcome here? Do us all a favor and resign. The city and state will be better without you involved in its politics.
110 days into this administration and tRump wins title of both dumbest and most corrupt president!
its time for China to take this little creep out. His actions threaten the whole world. We can no longer stand by and let this insane man carry on.
Viva la France.  Score one for the incompetent and corrupt leaders of the EU.
Unreal, a European pig along with the management team at Bombardier feeding at the Canadian taxpayer filled trough.  Typical... and our politicians wonder why the public is cynical.
Brooks must be feeling a need to ovulate.  The President is a buffoon.  Which of these two statements were made by a patriot?  Which by  a fool?  Correct answers: The first and the second, in that order.  Idiots who write for the Failing New York Times just don't get it.  Trump was voted in and Brooks and his band of jerks were booted. (of course I mean the swamp when I say band of jerks)  Apparently he doesn't "get it". I think we can explain it in the next 8 years.
evil, malicious and vindictive besides being "S".
This is a no-brainer but with all those wishy-washy Independents dabbling in the Democratic party process such basic facts are lost on many. One area of concern is Hillary's promise to tackle immigration reform in the beginning of her (eventual) administration. This sounds dubious to me as she will be unable to do anything of substance with the House in the hands of the looney Republicans.  It seems therefore that she is just playing a game where she can say, "We tried to tackle immigration reform but it didn't work"--this would be a sell-out for all the immigrants in limbo. I hope she doesn't make mistakes like Obama did--going for healthcare reform instead of making sure that Dems drew the congressional districts by winning the mid-term elections. Dems really dropped the ball by not showing up in that mid-term election--what a bunch of idiot losers all those stay at home Dems are. Now we're f*cked until the 2020 reapportionment.
"Hitler's idiocy in diverting German bombers away from RAF airfields and towards British cities helped the RAF win the day." It was Churchill's genius that brought out the idiocy in Hitler.   Churchill bombed Dresden specifically to pee off Adoph and it worked ...  in revenge for bombing the most cultured and beautiful of the German cities that was not involved in the war ... Adoph in anger bombed London for revenge but was a strategic mistake that allowed the advancement of other efforts to be made by Britain and its​ allies.  It wasn't as much Hitler's idiocy that lost the war, It was Churchill's genius.
Gold medal in idiocy. What an embarrassment.
so will the left become more cry babies making the usual ignorant accusations of extremism when the right is normal compared to the extreme lunatic left like you!
So who are the pigs here?...Definitely unskilled labour that thinks they are worth 15 bucks an hour. You want to make a better wage...well get the hell off your ass and get an education in a field that pays better!
Biographer Wayne Barrett on Donald Trump. "A Shocking Threat To The a World", Democracynow.org today. How can people really be so stupid as to vote for this man?
And that fact free population is universally voting for Clinton.   Ignorance is what gets liberal scum elected
The bloviating ignoramus loves to build great expectations - and then fails to deliver.   Eventually Murka will wake up.
Why do republicans always want to cut good things like education. Do they want to increase trump's voting block, the undereducated, the deplorables. Certainly looks like it. Republicans are terrible, nasty folks.
.  "Opinion polls have shown a narrow lead for a “Yes” vote, which would replace Turkey’s parliamentary democracy with an all-powerful presidency and may see Erdogan in office until at least 2029."  --  Who votes to turn their country from a democracy to a dictatorship?  Who votes to deny themselves and their children human rights?  Humans' capacity for stupidity never fails to amaze.  .
So now, Trump is threatening military action against Venezuela.  Sadly, Mr. Trump is a cowardly and boastful imbecile, who is threatening to send other peoples' children into war.  He's a pathetic moron.  His administration is a total failure.  With Trump at the top, success is impossible.
KO was branded a liberal nut job years ago. Nothing to see here but another looney tune idiot trying to make himself relevant. Its amazing that someone is stupid enough to hire him,
They were also all juveniles. And yes, there are other reasons for not publicizing who you're looking for. But if you're going to put the name of a person wanted for murder in the paper then it's pretty dumb to not put their picture in there too, and yeah that includes these current scumbags as well as the white scumbags from palmer.
These were screaming, raging, angry white men with torches, they surrounded a black Church and were going thru town rampaging against PoC. If brave, good people DIDN'T stand up to the terror these white supremacists were inciting, WHAT MORE VIOLENCE would the racists have inflicted!  Of course Trump defends his fellow white supremacists, is anyone surprised. He's a racist, bigoted hatemonger, plain & simple. He's a disgrace.
WTF? What liberals call malignant, the rest of us call winning. Sick bastards.
Support you 100% on this issue that is increasingly becoming more of a black eye on America to the view of the rest of the world and plenty of Americans at home. Especially when the government preaches "land of the free" ad nauseam.   Hypocrisy.  That said, I guess because your son didn't appear Chinese, he especially stood out in Montebello!
Wow. Need any more evidence that lobbyists are actively trying to destroy civilization? And this guy Toyofuku is the worst kind of lobbyist - a lobbyist for lawyers!!!  Why is it that the people who need advocacy least have a near monopoly on it? As if elected officials needed even more motivation to advance the interests of the powerful. Literally the only thing keeping us from full blown feudal serfdom is that corrupt, self-serving, profoundly idiotic officials like Scott Nishimoto need to get reelected every few years. Think about that next time you choose not to vote.
TRUMP IMORAL ? AFTER CLINTONS AFFAIR IN THE OVAL OFFICE ?
Sly,slick dictator and dullard dictator wannabe.
O'Leary is no Trump.  I predicted Trump's win days after he announced his intention to run in the primaries.  I will predict O'Leary will end up middle of the pack if he runs for the Canadian Conservatives.  Here's why.  Religion: There is no way on earth O'Leary is going to be able to pander to the Reform Party roots within the CPC.   His religion is greed, and there are thousands of clips of him saying things to this effect.  Success:  While Trump critics decry his bankruptcies and business failures, he does still own a vast empire of hotels and has his name on many more, along with golf courses.  Trump's wealth is real.  O'Leary, on the other hand would be easily discredited as a phony "rich guy".  Trump wasn't stupid enough to launch a mutual fund company that has done little to make money.  Returns are numbers and the numbers aren't good.  Bombast: Trump is, funny at times.  O'Leary is just an angry, mean, vindictive, jerk.  It makes him fun to watch but there's no inspiration.
I'm not sure it's so idiotic. I rather like the idea.
Is this journalism?  The author of this hit piece made no effort to hear the other side of the story.   Do you know what Peterson has had to deal with from the lunatic left?  Have you listened to any of his talks?  Pathetic. This is why mainstream journalism is no longer trusted by anyone with a brain.
The Republicans nominated that gross pig in the White House.  Now they have to sleep with him!
What hypocrites your sources are! They are not worried about any ethical problems or about any danger to national security--only about how to make the oppo  research public without being identified. The only difference between them and Trump Jr. is that the latter is more honest.  IMO, they were absolutely right to hear the Russians out.  What Trump Jr. would have done had it been useful info is strictly an assumption, and we are seeing a lot of confirmation bias here. (The Party Line Press (PLP) always construes any story to the  maximum disadvantage of the President.)  The Trump campaign might have even notified the FBI if it were incriminating info. After all, Hillary was already under investigation ( aka  Comey's whitewash).  Mike Lion  P.S. "Collusion" is not a crime, as some of your readers seem to think.
you have to be truly stupid and brain washed to call this anything but a reality check for the benefit of the usa. Trump and his realist certainly understand economics and reality too bad you do not. IT is ignorance you live in that should make you feel ashamed
Your posts get more idiotic all the time, Millertroll. It was your beloved Red Sux that had that clubhouse problem.
Lots of idiotic comments on here , especially bob doug mac ,from people who have probably never bought a home before . Or over payed  or left money on the table selling . Funny you know , I know a lot of people who have a lot of money they acquire all they're  real estate through a knowledgeable agent. If they need legal advice they go to the best lawyer . Accounting advice they go to a real accountant.  These people who think the internet has solved everything from real estate to legal and medical advise are truly laughable.  As with any profession there are good bad and crooked in all of them. A little less limited thinking and you may be able to spot the hazards.
The biggest pieces always float to the top. Go away Kevin Meyer. Just retire, sell ur stuff and move away from the state u helped usher into insolvency. Meyer rhymes with liar. What a creep u and ur vapid republican moron thief legislative  friends are....
"Kiz: Is it time for Brocktober?"  My prediction was this would take 6 games.  Silly, silly me.  This is such low hanging fruit it's grown roots, and now is nothing more than a plant that needs fertilizer.  Enter Kiz.
"I am a PC..."  I can go one better. The Justin Liberals have me registered as a supporter, and they are so unbelievably stupid.   I get these e-mails: "Sophie Gregoire Trudeau says thank-you!" "Justin says thank-you!"  Guess what, Justin? You're an incompetent, A roofer, a waste. ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀  "Sophie Gregoire-Trudeau sings kumbaya to that." "Justin says thank-you, and just punched himself in the face."
Well if your dumb enough to point a gun at yourself then you deserve what you get.
Still waiting clowney. BTW, 97%? Really? Exaggerations are typical of the left after feeding at the MSM slop trough for too long. Then you probably finish that off with some kool-aid, supersized right. Bon apetit.
Pig-shaming will get you nowhere but JimmyO shaming, Jimmy. It's childish and typically immature, coming from a demented Lefty (oops! "Lefty-shaming" !! ). You're not being civil nor are you being "tolerant" as you've told us we all should be, Jimmy.
....if only they could, but why would they when welfare (aka dumb canuck christians paying their $$!)
People like you are the reason the west is so weak.
You sound like a special kinda stupid
You are sick for supporting madman deranged Trump.
But it WAS you, you murdering scum bag.
Could you use some of that trivial research and explain why any one of his points is claptrap?  They seem pretty sensible to me and I don't know how to dispute them.  Or will you call me a fool and assume you won the argument?
Nice try Troll, the space in your name and the lack of a real blue dot prove that you are a sham, you were probably the one who was talking about the "I Love" Caucus taking over the assembly with Constant and Reivera's successful election yesterday. Please go away
You'd be exhausted too if you had to haul a huge gut, a fat rear end, and an ugly mop excuse of hair around......
"Unpopular" is a gross understatement when it comes to attitudes towards Trump. Among women who find him repulsive in the extreme (100% of the women I know) there is a sincere hope that Trump succumbs to a fatal disease as soon as possible and this regardless of the fact that Pence, whose acute idiocy by all accounts, is overshadowed only by Trump's excessive perversion, would succeed him.
gov H did squat , so did the dems and gop members - NADA ZILCH,   just as morons or lazy polticians would do.    NOTHING!!
I'd say being mean and stupid got us where we are, and it sure won't get us out. you seem to lump them all together as one typical mob of mentals and just want them out of sight while thinking they can all simply suck it up and pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. the homeless are essentially everybody, those who can are trying to endure the stifling dead end rat race, the rest are hopeless, you can't beat them into compliance and still call yourself humane. it's common sense and proven to start with truly permanent homes so the worst can maybe gain trust and then the services are enabled for eventual / possible stability towards functioning reasonably. without homes you can't expect anything from anybody but despair.
BINGO! Since when is it illegal to talk to a Russian anyway? What a bunch of pathetic sore-losers suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome. It's actually kind of sad to watch the collective meltdown
These two pieces of trash will be re-elected.  Just watch.
You say not even close but you don't give any reason. If he wasn't an unpleasant person he wouldn't've acted as irresponsibly and belligerently as he did. He made himself "right" by his course of action. He manipulated the situation to his own benefit. that's why he's an opportunist and scammer just like the macdonal's woman.
That's a dumb analogy!
BOO HOO!! I was called a slut, whore for all of my high school years because the older guys looked at me. 4 years of pure hell. I didn't go into the school and shoot it up. Screetch is nothing!!! wow.
Go ahead and keep letting muslim animals in and the Alaskan people will take them out if they start anything. No islam in public schools! People dont want them here because of their heretical beliefs that are violent and dispicable!  ONE honor killing in Alaska and they ALL go! ONE case of fgm and they ALL go! ONE terrorist act and they all die! The Alaskan people have spoken!
Who the hell voted for this cancerous a-hole Brownstain? Bernstein and Woodward have lived on one story for well over 40 years. Wrote a book about Hillary that was fairy-tale like. The public doesn't need sewage like this lying and distorting the truth to them. Time to put this senile dinosaur out to pasture.
they are donating to a foundation in your fathers name, they are paying for the creation and erection of a statue of commemorating your father  what am I missing Justin?  are you saying I am just stupid?
“Because you can’t be like he’s been and be a multi-billionaire,” Bailey said. “You don’t get there by being a buffoon. So I’m really crossing my fingers.”  This is the disconnect. For all you so called "fiscally conservative" independent voters who blindly vote R, Trump sucks at investing.  http://www.moneytalksnews.com/why-youre-probably-better-investing-than-donald-trump/
You really missing that commonsense ain't you? They march over people who were unjustified shot by the police. If you can't see the difference, wait im just going save my breath. Make America great again like the 1950s right? My kids shouldnt have tonplay with kids from other races at school. Am I right brother or what?  The world be better off when racist people like you are out of it imo
Wow, over 130 comments.  To the naysayers, keep it up, for every idiotic comment you make there comes about 5 rational comments.  To those that actually added to the conversation in a NON moronic way (and that excludes me, darn it) goodonya.
idiotic comment ... brazil is not third world, bigger example of brazilians if you know someone or there was talk about some mother who had son with zika, nobody knows a single case and not even talk on brazilians day. many tests were done on mostly babies gave negative to zika. in fact zika was only chat to hurt Brazil, because it was year of Olympics and the international media needed negative news, because they tried everything to cancel games in Brazil, but they did not succeed
So you're suggesting it's good to give into fear. Nonsense. That kind of narrow-minded behaviour hurts the US far more than it hurts those denied entry for being true to themselves. If you don't understand this you are sadly a mental midgit.
What a more onic statement.   Those 2 individuals have produced jobs for millions of Canadians to feed their family.   Would you rather they were on welfare and living off other taxpayers?  People this stupid...
I'm sorry but this is wrong..yes they should have taken the high road but this person provocted much this...not smart. People are really angry! And they should be because the see their country turning to the dark side...lies, propaganda, stupid actions. The immigration stance was stupid, really poorly throughout, unless your goal is foment fear and radicalize the right...think a Steve Bannon. He what's the fight so bad he can taste it! And he will choose specific actions to create the kind of hate and division that supports the anger we see, and if the Prince of Orange continues, will get worse. But please cut out the meme that the left has to be the pasivists, "lock her up," that we don't have real reasons to be really angry!
"This is been debunked completely." And this remains the gold standard of hogwash from those Grubered on the left, as usual uninformed and unknowledgeable.  Btw. The Haitian people are not the liars, Crooked Hillary is over and over proven to be a liar.
"Alaska has no chance as long as such nitwits remain."  Exactly.  We can't expect these morons to fix anything.  This is why I keep suggesting we collect the billions owed from audits and wait until we have a completely new legislature before making any big moves.  Why would we let these incompetent corrupt idiots start an income tax and tap the permanent fund earnings?
Yep. No big surprise is it? We can't get rid of Trump and his hypocritical religious nut wingman, Pence, quickly enough.
lol, no it is generally only republicans who are idiots.  The Donald could have led the charge for medicare for all and he probably would have succeeded.  But instead he wants tax cuts for the rich and the hell for the common man.  I wonder if Trump supporters are waking up yet?  I am not all that smart, but smarter than most republicans who have abandoned republican values.  Just remember deficits don't matter when they are in charge.
I swear, half of this damn town uses heroin or meth. If you're a parent keep an eye on your kids, there is an excellent chance they use one or both of these substances.
what's shocking is there's even 1 who ever supported the brat
The lying, disingenuous, mentally impoverished sociopath is at it again. His god must love him.
A supremely degenerate face to communicate for a supremely degenerate president. This presidency is offensive to all civilized people and is the lowest point the United States has sunk to in generations. These are people you wouldn't want anywhere near your family members or in your home. They are vile and disgusting.
Well, she's an IDIOT, so it is expected that her comments are irrelevant.
Conservatives advocate in favor of the torture of Canadian children! Disgusting!
Liberals like Larry are angry, disturbed people who can do nothing but scream how conservatives are filled with hate. But it is Leftists who spew their hatred and intolerance, most often on social media – the coward’s way of dialog. Read some of the tweets about the murdered cops in Dallas and Baton Rouge. Who spits on Trump supporters while screaming profanities? Leftists. Who attacks and beats up Trump supporters? Leftists. Who marches in the streets of American cities shouting “Pigs in a blanket, fry’em up like bacon”? Leftists. Who shuts down conservative speakers at universities, denying free speech? Leftists. Who hates Christianity? Leftists. For fascists like Larry, bereft of a coherent argument, the only thing to do is bellow that people he disagrees with are racists and haters. It’s pathetic, but a shining example of the decline of our education system.
If you think this government "ruined the energy sector in Alberta" you are either a) delusional or b) a liar who thinks the rest of us are really, really stupid.   It's simply shocking that anyone can get away with uttering preposterous, vicious, falsehoods like this in a national forum that is supposed to be self-regulated. It's not only offensive, it's destructive and dangerous.
NEVER EVER HIRE A NEGROE FOR EMEGENCY CALLS,,,THEY THE NEGROES ARE NOT SMART ENOUGH TO MAN PHONES EVEN THO A MONKIE CAN DO IT,,,NEGROES ARE NOTHING MORE THAN FARM IMPLEMENTS IE COTTON PICKERS
By your words and actions, I would think that you are the racist and Neo-Nazi from your polluted rhetoric.  I pity people like you for being so hate filled.  What a way to go through life.  mtf1953, Sad, huh????
As expected, the point just flew right over your head. They aren't bad but Leaf fans have a learning disorder.
There is no Senator Koch from Ohio, I checked.  I guess you are just ignorant.
I read your comments twice and you never mentioned once that Trump said he wouldn't release his tax returns.  You mentioned everybody in the world saying he wouldn't, but no quote from Trump.   Am I missing something or are you just dumb as a rock?
This guy is an arrogant douchebag, Clinton or no Clinton.
By all accounts the Cherokee is an absolute piece of crap.
Here's a liar, lying to cover for the liars she works for.
I starred this guy because he's so desperate. I mean these exchanges might be meaningless but beating Republicans' ass in November surely isn't. It can help Americans save face and prove to the rest of the world they're not knuckle dragging cretins. Repudiation--it's the only way to deal with Republicans, otherwise, America is the land of cretins. I'm convinced that Americans are cretins and I have plenty of evidence to back my claim. But every little bit of evidence to the contrary could help those who have a stake in supporting the contrary.
OMG, what an exhaustingly ignorant ahole LaPage is.
He must think Canadians are a bunch of morons to beleive him.  He has obviously gone to the Wynne school of politic.
Isn't Socialism great. All the government has to do is continually ask for more money/revenue/taxes, so they can provide additional services.  No problem with that, everyone has loads of extra cash to send to government coffers !  The populace wants more. They want the government to deliver. They can't help themselves, someone else must do that for them (at extra cost). Then, they complain about tax rates, etc., etc., etc..   The never-ending loop of stupidity continues !
Bold faced liar
Because he-like most of the left-can only name call and are in fact the epitome of the very accusations they make, i.e. trolls, idiots, etc.
"Former Honolulu Mayor Mufi Hannemann, now president and CEO of the Hawaii Lodging & Tourism Association, called the TAT “highly volatile” and suggested the GET is a more stable funding source for the project."  Be GONE you LYING LOSER!
BLM was started on a "lie"? LOL. Even if that were true, it's hilarious how some are #triggered by BLM (how dare they!!!) but support a blatant and pathological liar like Dump.
Just pointing out that "These corrupt bastards" are voted in by us.  In many cases, multiple times over the years.  When it comes to State government, we simply need to look in the mirror to find where the real blame goes. ;)
mr obama , one of the most useless narcissist to be president
How do the Cons attract such horrible candidates?  He wants to auction off Senate seats to the richest Canadians.  Just a complete clown car at this moment.  I predict third place in 2019.
Wow!!  Reading your comments are incredible!  According to you nothing should be done until the actual crime is committed(molestation of a 5 yr. and 7yr old child is actually committed), then law enforcement should intervene???  You are just as sick. IMO!
It williams be interesting if this starts a full audit into all their expense claims by an independent auditor!  I suspect there are quite a few pigs at the trough!
We had better hope that Trump is just taunting, like a schoolyard bully. If he is serious and strikes North Korea for any reason, millions would die. Just because you think it wouldn't be you makes no difference to the world. Kim Jong-un knows Trump is posturing. You and tens of millions of American meat heads have been chanting "Nuke 'em" since the Korean War, more than sixty years ago. Fortunately, so far every US president has had the good sense to ignore the idiots. Let's hope Trump has that much sense.  Robinson's suggestion that Trump open discussions and meet directly with Kim is very reasonable
What a doofus he was.  Even more than a half-century ago to us college students, he seemed totally over the top with his smoking jacket, slippers, pipe, brandy snifter, and babes hanging all over himself.
Wait...did I just read something realllly stupid?
I'm fine with letting the expletives fly in appropriate situations. But when salty language is used in the wrong settings, it just makes you look like a moron.
They want even define Islamophobia. Ridiculous.
I'm trying to figure out how Kevin got my email address to try and solicit funds to his campaign. I mean I'd go out of my way to provide money and support to anyone opposing Kevin. The last thing this country needs is Mr. Fool leading a major political party.  I immediately put in a halt to further crap from him.
When Colon Kapperkneeler first kneeled he was calling the police "pigs" in support of Black Lies Matter. The rest of the Kneelers are supporting Kapperkneeler in calling the police "pigs" The disrespect is against heroes like Officer Charleston Hartfield who was murdered by the mass murder in Las Vegas while off duty helping save lives of those under fire. To label heroes like this,  "pig" is so vile and contemptuous.  I didn't hear of any of the Kneelers doing anything to help. I hope the NFL and all the players go broke and enjoy their concussions. Hockey players don't kneel.
The first time I could vote, Reagan's good old American optimism and  personal charm won my vote.  Supply-side (trickle-down) economics made sense to a college kid looking ahead to a bright future.  Then, less than a year in office, his Office of Management and Budget whiz kid David Stockman admitted that no one really knew "what was going on with all those numbers."  I came to realize that a kindler, gentler world doesn't run like an equation, especially one that continually allows the rich to get richer---and the poor to get poorer.   I didn't vote for RR the next time, but never stopped liking him, never doubted his sincerity.  This ldiot inhabiting the White House is no Ronald Reagan.  And his wife doesn't love him.
No actually. They will sit down like any other woman. Stop being ignorant
"Says the retired garbage man" ... What a typical liberal elitist comment. What does that have to do with anything? The fact he made an honest living makes me more likely to listen to Richard and less likely to listen to a elitist like you, or a convicted felon like Ms Moore.
Well, you would normally say that the "rats are jumping ship" with the CEOs, but in this case perhaps they are smarter animals like owls or maybe the Republican's symbol, an elephant, how ironic.  What a loser, as the tsunami backlash has just begun.  I  have made an observation, identify the most idiotic thing you can do with a given situation and unfailingly he will pick it.   For example, he will likely pardon the racist Arpaio soon to triple-down on his own prejudice.  Did you know his dad was arrested while marching with the KKK in NYC (1927).  "The apple doesn't fall far from the tree".
There appears to be about 30-40% of trumps' voters who are racist fools.  That swung the election for trump.  (I am sure that you did not notice that! *eye roll*)
What a stupid thing to say. Take a course on trading. By your logic markets would stay at the same price in perpetuity. I can assure you that at this point in the cycle it will take surprisingly little to go from a buyers market to a sellers market. When the sellers overpower buyers you'll see prices tank. The fact that I have to even explain this elementary concept reminds me that there is no fix for stupid.
Romeo, you are the biggest coward ever because you did not act to save the slaughtered people of Rwanda. Suffer you dirty pig. You can never outlive your shame!
The stupidity is from the GTA. Quebec and the Maritimes vote Liberal because it's in their financial interest as deadbeats to do so.
"He says it's like letting someone with a limp start at the 20-metre mark in a 100-metre race,"  What, he mocking the disabled! Fire that insensitive monster, he should never be allowed near our precious special snow-flake millennials (Sarc-off).  Sadly, what the good professor is rightly railing against is the “Post-secondary education division” of the SJW industry…
I beg to differ, you may have a different definition of tyranny than the rest of the world, but that doesn't make you right. You are a blithering fool, and I see no use to continue discussions with you. Good luck in your alternate universe.
Outsider77:   I do NOT Trust any Politician, I believe they are all Corrupt.   A new Political System is in order...............
Well now, if Donald Trump is such a scoundrel, and he shellacked Crooked Hillary, what does that say about the Donkey Party???  HEEEEEAAAAAAWWWWW   HEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWW
When you are choosing between two identical candidates who are compulsive liars, utterly corrupt, wholly untrustworthy and would stab you in the back without a thought, why would anyone want to endorse any of the two candidates here. Neither Hillary or Donald got our nation's interest at heart. They are both in it for themselves. Pair of greedy leeches and no matter who win, we Americans will lose. In one of my other comments, I asked....endorsing any of the two candidates is like picking who you like better....Hitler or Stalin. But regardless, we got people picking Hitler over Stalin or Stalin over Hitler, just like this old retiring politician like Warner. Can't see the evils in front of him, that both of them are useless and stupid.
R i g h t .... "de-legitimize Trump's presidency".  Have you sobered up enough to listen to Trump speak?  Even Fox News is calling Trump "unhinged".  So why waste your unemployment cheque on the G&M Sheep?  Why not fill the Breitbart comments with your slobbering drivel.  They would love you over there!  Oh!  I see! You are paid to write your nonsense. (Pathetic moron - seriously, you are truly laughable)
a world of empty headed poseurs?  yes in the USA for sure and Toronto probably  but the rest of canada is not that stupid
Don't bother.  Being a 'poor thing' is 100% better than being a willfully ignorant white supremacist
And you're the meaning of stuck on stupid.  No cure for that.  So sad.
even idiotic bigots?
I and many others will stop watching if that clown comes to Denver, he has ruined the fun of watching what the nation has loved for years by bringing social issues to a GAME!!! Not the place for it....period!
Bro, no one in my family dodged the draft. No one my family knows dodged the draft. Some died in that BS war and the rest got spit on whn they came home. Don’t give me that, “bro they all did it” garbage. That is a load of apologist garbage.   Trump has not said anything about McCain and left him alone? Maybe if you have been looking at the view underneath the beach, bro.  If you want to make excuses for a the draft dodging coward Trump, that is your right, America! Have a great night, bro, but do not urinate on my neck and tell me it is raining.
Keep this loser in prison before he kills someone!!!
Which accusations against Trump[ have been "proven wrong"?  To my knowledge, none.  Trump's denial lacks credibility, after he has repeatedly bragged about his assaultive behavior.  Wht if your beautiful, innocent daughter were grabbed by her breasts and genital organs by someone she trusted as a mentor?  How would you react?  Do you really want this monster, who praises the dictator Putin, insults dead veterans, and calls women "pigs", as president?  And you call Democratic voters "fools"?  Have you looked in the mirror lately?
No one from the opposite side of the political spectrum will take you seriously if you continue to call the PM junior. It's immature, and given the fact that both the NDP's and Tory's leaders are younger than Justin makes it even more ridiculous.   You have a problem with his politics, fine, debate them, but don't resort to immature name calling that is at the best, hypocritical.
??? Fake News!!!  "In response to your idiotic reply to my post...", "PS don't reply to my posts..."...I don't know if your second screen identity is Surfer_Dude or not but Nitro08 wasn't responding to you...Could it be that all the Trumpers in here are actually the same person, NP5491😲😲😲#MAGA
the deal was completed under Harper all she did was represent Canada at the signing. It is incredible how stupid you liberals are.
He's  currently under investigations  & his fake university ruled to be fraud. The fake trump support is also severely  sick.
Yes, the sharks will hear you breathing and chew through your sail boat. This isn't "Jaws" lol. Idiots.....there might be a reason other boats left them alone.......US Navy thwarts Darwin yet again -_-
Ummm....yeah. Make up your own history much. You are a liar.
Walter: You choose to dismiss Mr. Trump's sociopathic behavior as "the Democatic narrative", then youi attempt ot deflect the conversation to a discussion of Ms Clinton.  News Flash: Donald Trump is our President and he continues to operate in an extremely unstable fashion and display the characteristics of a sociopath.  Attempts to trivialize concerns with his mental/emotional health and its impact on his ability to do the job of being President are not going to work.  The situation is way beyond something which can simply be dismissed as "dirty politics" from those nasty Democrats.  If you want people to quit commenting that Mr. Trump acts like a sociopath, perhaps you should convince him to quit acting like a sociopath.  Gary Crum
Charge the moron.  FORMALLY charge the moron. We've spent years, and thousands, trying to offset the longstanding damage of bullies. Trying to reverse the trend. This twit implies that bullying builds character!? For what?! For a few days in the limelight again after his drug-riddled career is fading from centre stage. Enough. Alleged 'actors' are people who make millions standing where someone tells them to stand and saying what someone else again tells them to say. Your average parrot has more talent and more intelligence than most alleged 'actors'.  And this guy thinks he's a voice we should hear. Switch off Kimmel. Bury Perry in legal challenges and issues. Move on to common sense.
Because Trudeau is a traitor himself! So of course he would side with this man....just look where he comes from...
IF we had national leadership on Pipelines; one to the west, one the east, one to the north combined with Canada Energy (oil and Natural Gas for Canadians first and export at world price) there would be no problem. But we have no leadership at the federal level so every special interest group feels they have a right to say something. And we all know, they want money or the big fat envelope. This is the consequence of no national leadership. As I used to say at work; "talking about an issue is code for doing nothing"' as a result nothing gets done and taxpayers money is wasted. Take NB for example we have a 100% liberal MP's in NB, not a word, no strategy not a thing, meanwhile  we import Saudi Oil. How does that make sense, as we pipeline our Canada oil and Natural Gas to the US at a hudge discount. How stupid is that!!!!!. So stupid we even have Justin supporting Keystone. Imagine the PM paying off his US buddies as if it mattered.
Hey look, the Globe and Mail is still PRETENDING that Vancouver (and, increasingly, Toronto) have high house prices for a reason that is somehow NOT overseas money flooding in.  Give it a rest, Globe and Mail. Readers are not as stupid as you seem to assume.  Vancouver house prices cost dozens of times the average annual local income.  There is NO WAY - repeat, there is NO WAY - to get house prices that high without external money flooding in. It is an IMPOSSIBILITY for local wages to get house prices to 24 times, to 30 times, to 36 times the average annual local income.   Not green space. Not mountains. Not low interest rates. Not environmentalists.  It is OVERSEAS MONEY flooding in to Vancouver that has gotten house prices so high. It is the ONLY mechanism that fits the fact pattern.  So please, Globe and Mail, drop the nonsense.
No fools like you who choose to use unethical dirty foreign oil over heavily regulated Canadian oil are the problem  Even after an entire town is blown up from rail derailment you and your confused  ilk continue press forward. Yes any hope of nation building just died, a true Liberal victory!!! And people wonder how Trump was created !!! 2019 can't come fast enough, expect rage.
So Mr. Photo Op vacations on a private island with his islamic spiritual advisor, and refuses to attend the inauguration of the new U.S. President.  Kinda tells you everything you need to know about Mr. Photo Op and why he hates Canada and our way of life!  Way to go all you Canadian fools that elected a Western hating muslim to be your prime minister!
So we're all buffoons then ? Left, centre, right ?   That would make anyone 'surly'.
There you go again proving that you know the best way to screw up a prosecutors case ensuring you cannot possibly get 'justice' from the 'justice system'.  Just stop already we get it you are an angry woman and willing to engage in criminal acts to try and get even with the person you think did you wrong.... totally screwing any case against that person and putting yourself at risk of going to jail for utter stupidity.   CONGRATS we get it.
Hope they can also charge the dumb ass with something who brought it to the party.  I'm very seldom in favor of more laws on the books, but maybe we need one along the lines against having a firearm at a party where alcohol and drugs are being consumed?  If you can't operate a vehicle with a BAL above .8, you shouldn't be allowed to operate a firearm either (that includes no dancing with one) what stupid morons.....
The Zuptas have stolen it. You are somewhat delusional. Place the blame where it is due.
Carl Z. is so stuck on stupid.  Trump and Duterte are "two of a kind" because Trump wants to meet with him?  What a Bozo.  Oh, Obama talks with the mullahs in Iran and gives them $150 Billion and that's OK.  Never mind Iran is the world's largest state sponsor of terror.
Rats. You beat me to it.
Malignant: Spiteful, malicious, malevolent, evil-intentioned, vindictive, vengeful, malign, mean, nasty, hurtful, mischievous, wounding, cruel, unkind. Sounds just like the MSM and the democratic party. I wonder if he thinks the foul-mouthed DNC chair, Tom Perez, is malignant? Perez drops the F-Bomb quicker that a five dollar hooker drops her draws.
Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is a proven racist and former supporter of the KKK. The sooner he's gone, the better.
His handlers obviously pulled his ears and made him call out the klan and white supremacists "and other hate groups". The man is an inept moron.
the marathon is and will always be a great fitness challenge for just about anyone, of any shape or size, its also been called the "smart person's" fitness test because you do have to be smarter than most to finish this event standing up and ready for work Monday morning.  but any a-type idiot can finish a marathon with very little "training" and then whine about their shin splints after.  sadly many who take up this challenge for the first time do not dedicate the necessary time and energy, read the books, do the stretching, eat the right foods, etc.   stupid is as stupid does they say.  and there is nothing wrong with a non-runner who starts with some short distance races leading up to the full 26.2 miles.  finishing a marathon in the smart way is a great memory that anyone can do.  what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.
Helping social parasites leech off of the citizens who work is not contributing to society. Your help is like a social cancer on our community.
But but but He HAS to be a terrorist! He’s brown and he’s a Muslim!  Whereas that lone wolf crazy white guy that shot 58 people  He’s NOT A TERRORIST
You write that post, and you think Palestinians are "stupid"?
Geez, hasn't Las Vegas suffered enough without a visit from this clown?
So far everyone though Eric was the dumb one.......  Can't imagine the brotherly 'noogies' at the family dinners these days......
Home grown extremists in my a$$. He's an  islamic terrorist  by his own admission.
Bastards Aholes Tyrants and Fornicators............BATF
If they did this they should be locked away for good.  Disgusting, sick POS.
the different is the cult left wing stupidity and lies as usual from liberals such as promising to leave carbon to the provinces but now forcing a national price, like pay for access, like more taxation, like more hand outs to propaganda bs cbc, like loving dictators over democracy, , ya some different alright
What a waste of tax dollars. just somemore nepotisim so some useless kid gets a job. Time to throw them out.
Well well well! I guess, in terms of analysis of this situation, it's the manifestly-deranged opinion of you in collaboration with that fascist clown-beast pretender Donald J Trump vs people like me and the rest of the rest of the civilized world, who value living in that civilized state, free of the wrongful noxious predilections of cretins and barbarians. Good luck with that?
SUCH a ridiculous dog-and-pony show ... them clowns could go on financially "milking" this charade for decades. The journalists were being kind/circumspect/cautious ... but must have been chuckling to themselves after recording the comments ... :(
What a load of crap:) Making excuses for a disgusting person?
So today a Democrat contract worker gets caught LEAKing classified material and the SA BURIES the story immediately. Had it been a Republican, it would be front page news for the rest of the week. The media will never get it. People are sick of the onesided coverage of political news already. These clowns are just cutting their own throat. Just as well any way.
As more and more media outlets eliminate or severley restrict their comments sections, the hacks, trolls, paid posters,  have fewer places to post their garbage and hate, and gravitate here.  But at least my speech is still free.
You are clearly a horrible rapper.
bullshit - trump is the worse eve fake president.  he cannot speak using more than 7 words in a sentence and constantly repeating himself.  sounds like a broken record.  what has he done to fulfill his promises?  making executive ordes?  these are just empty words, no action.  you need legislation to get action.  just talking about things is totally silly.  he is so dumb and stone would look smarter.
this should have gone all the way thru Canada court system ( as broken as it is )if ithey said 20 million of but this terrorist should of faced Canadians. Terrorist and a coward
You're just a troll.  You don't even have an account of your own.
A whole bunch of what if's. This is how the left spews its garbage. Keep on spreading crap that doesnt make any sense or have any truth to it and sooner or later maybe someone will believe a piece of it.
"Really, Steven, so anything written by someone you deem right leaning can't be true. "  That's untrue and even a troll likes you know it.  Your dishonesty is brazen.

ugg, who would vote for this woman. she is hideous, full of contempt, lies about everything, and wants to screw everybody over equally.
Bad idea to let anti-hunters to submit ideas to the Board. Like checking traps every 24 hours. Pure stupidity.
I was taught by my elders years ago that even a clown, a buffoon or even an over-educated ignoramus could occasionally, at least, know something that I didn't and that if I listened to everyone I could learn something of value to me.  That has proven to be true whether it is Mr. Gerson, real life, or even the subjective, bisased and often ignorant  opinions I read regularly here on this R-G site.
I'm pretty sure she knew what she was doing. And she basically made Donald Trump look like a fool, once again, for even responding to an irrelevant sports reporter.
And the article ends by saying Trump needs to coddle and embrace mainstream media.  That's funny.  You don't hug sewer rats.
I'm sorry, but Donald Trump needs to be flipped off by the entire world. Juli Briskman just did what the vast majority of our country wants to do. Trump is a disgusting excuse of a human being, and it's a disaster that he's making decisions that affect our country.
Unbelievable. I am shocked at how many people are completely ignorant of the actual law, yet offer an opinion. If you offer a service to the public, you cannot refuse this service to people that are in a protected class.  When you sign a business application, you agree to abide by state laws, rules and regulations. Colorado law says that sexual orientation is a protected class. Political thought is not a protected class.  You do not have to make a cake for a democrat. You do have to make a cake for a gay.
John Kerry. You sir are an idiot!! How in the hell did you become Secretary of State, and how in the hell did you become a US Senator. Did your brief stint in Vietnam cause some kind of mental problem, or were you just always like that and nobody caught it? North Korea is a "man made (looming) disaster". Climate Change is a "natural phenomina" that needs no catalyst, but may well deserve some degree of human intervention to mitigate the effects - addressing the result vs. the cause. You serve no cause, other than your own or AlGore, to make these ridiculously stupid statements.
Canada is a country waiting to happen.   And roadblocked by the incredulous stupidity and corruption of politicians.  And a lethargic, complacent electorate.
Thats population control for stupid and braindead. Let them kill themselves.
Why should I care about what this clown thinks? I'm sure he would be open to Trump telling him how to direct his dumb movies.
This ABOMINATION / ACA needs to go away...period  You bleeding Hearts be damned! So should LISA!!
No. What should happen next is omit all of Sword's gradings, opinions, decisions, conclusions, and scores for all the applicants. Aiu did ask Sword to announce there was a familial relationship between themselves and Sword did NOT do so. What a SCHMUCK! Aiu should continue be considered along with the rest. Re-add up the scores sans Schmuck Sword's. What a corrupt fool.
While Rome burns, Limerick becomes an insufferable pedant.  "...no one is above reproach..."  Does that apply to Hitler, Stalin, Togo, Pol Pot, et al?  Kim is developing  hydrogen bombs and an ICBMs to obliterate the U.S. and his Iranian friends share the same goal. They are aided and abetted by the PRC, Pakistan, and Russia.  Islamic terrorists want to explode a WMD in a major city.  The MSM, intelligence and state departments along with the DoJ are initiating a soft coup to destroy a democratically-elected president who has committed no obvious crime.  The "investigation" into "obstruction of justice" is particularly ominous because it shows that Mueller has no regard for the law, just as federal courts have ignored the president's clear legal right to ban groups he believes are dangerous, especially when they come from countries which do not provide any information for proper vetting.  The failure to investigate felony leaks is also a major problem.  Worrying about a word is silly.
that Tater Tot is such a fool.  can we ship him out.  where the hell are we going to house them and who is going to pay for them.  Not to mention security escalation costs.
humanrights: his remark is beyond foolish. young girl fighting back may have saved her life this afternoon. thank you for your post.
The right to free speech was enshrined in the constitution, as a right, for exactly the reason the "dotard" displayed this week.  The right was established to protect the speakers from suppression, just as "dotard" has attempted with his tweets and his rally comments. The framers of the constitution anticipated that some speech would be unpleasant for some who disagreed with the message to hear. You would think "Dotard", as leader of this representative democracy would understand that. Sadly, he doesn't. How sad for us.
John that racist troll is faking other people's accounts.  He's faking two accounts now, 907AK's original account and this Resist Trump account.  He's a worthless troll.
Oh wow Luddite here Guess what I am the majority and you look really really stupid
Boy, you really reached for the dregs of the propaganda barrel.  It almost makes one nostalgic for a slick troll like Marty E.
Are they sure its not brain surgery. She has been saying some stupid things lately.
Does insurance pay for this nonsense? Utterly stupid
Wow BC is full of as many idiots as Quebec.
be truthful, you don't love ben, you love what he stands for - anti rail.  about muslims, whose religion hates women, hates all other religions, will kill anyone who so much denigrate their religion, hates gays, etc.  do you love them?  do you love whites that hate blacks and all minorities?  or hate them?  do you hate native Hawaiians who hate haoles?  you are a hypocrite.
Ontario had same problem in the mid 1970's....they fixed it with speculator taxation....problem fixed overnight as a result.  Interesting back then to note the number of MPs that got caught with their pants down when the taxation came into play. Virtually everybody in Ontario that had any assets was playing the game and making easy $.  Sad that it took five years for Ontario to act given that it was an previous problem with a solution that had a proven track record for succeeding. Only the very stupid intentionally ignore history and repeat making the same mistake time after time after time.
The Dem and Repub back and forth blame game is comical.  NEITHER party wants to put in place a system that controls cost/profit of the health industry.  Both are on the take, and they have their morons fighting for them like it makes a difference.
The fascist left are lunatics.
The law takes president over any silly beliefs. Muslims need to find this out as well.
what's wrong? everything the lefty way, don't think so cry babies! Lefties like to kill the unborn! Lefties now want to erase history, not going to happen.  Call for the assassination of OUR President.  President Trump! say it cry babies.  what's the matter bob? go look up Hanoi Jane and maybe cry together.
Hypocrite writes:  "Thomas. Do you know what "directly" means? Toodaloo!"  --  Yes, actually I do.  Thanks for asking.
Buffet is scum....how do you think he got so rich?  And why do you think he supported Hillary?
The trap I constantly see observers falling into is attempting to assess Trump's strategic thinking in various circumstances.  There is one possibility that often goes overlooked: He doesn't have one.  The hazards of inaccurately projecting meaning onto his behavior has three obvious dangers:   One is that there is a tendency to cut him some critical slack when his actions are perceived as the product of deliberate & careful thought.  The second is that once meaning is projected onto his actions, then that gets ensconced as truth and used for further deeper & even more inaccurate interpretations.  Finally, the third is that it blinds analysts to the possibility that Trump's inscrutable methods are actually as idiotic as they seem at first glance.
oh please take that commy bs and get educated, its not govs job to regulate salaries ,, metro is a business with costs and the gov is sending much of those costs soaring 32% bud overnight, yet you think the bad guy is the business trying to keep profitable?? ha ha what an ignorant
The men in prison will give this low life an anal awakening  Maybe after they make him their bitch, they'll beat up on him for sexual gratification  Cut him up a little too. while their at it, give him some of his own medicine. NOT A MAN IF HE HITS A WOMEN-
yo stewie  you are the worst journalist ever, you are a complete failure and no one really likes you either.  How's that for populist banter
Latinos are utter losers -
And you, of course, would be just as flippant and cavalier in telling these muslim businesses to do close up their shops too, right?  http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/3/video-muslim-bakers-points-double-standard-gay-wed/
Don't worry about Incest In Sight and Fail Kabooby, Johann. They're just intimidated by your intelligence and quick wit. They're so used to listening to Trump--who has, at most, a 7 word vocabulary--and his sound bites that their brains have atrophied.  Big words and elegant phrasing confuse them.   They attack you and not the issues because a. They don't recognize or understand the issues you address b.  Even if they did understand, they have no valid counter-argument to offer. In short, they're losers i.e. Trumpists.
What a dumb comment. I'm a life long conservative, and I certainly expect my public servants to work together and get things done.
Matt Ryan should be re-assigned to the Saskatchewan Roughriders' farm club in Lower East Elbow.  He is really awful.
Oh Ed - the angelic voices of the pro-life marchers singing Kumbaya for all God's children..... Except the evil fornicators who deserve to burn in n firey heIl for all eternity and whose choices you wish to control, whose will you seek to crush, who are wrong, wrong, wrong.... I feel the love and acceptance..
Disgusting!
Unbelievable how you people applaud the fact that they are stealing your money. If they can get away with taxing one way they quietly add another tax, then another, then jam it up higher. More taxes only lowers your standard of living. And people CLAP TO THIS? Are you all that stupid?
The lack of education is not because it doesn't exist, but because the voters seek out only the opinions and "facts" that support their viewpoint, and concentrate on irrelevant issues. The voters are politically stupid.
Would never vote for ANYONE who supports Trump.  He and Weinstein are two of a kind predators....... Straight out of Trump's Mouth, QUOTING the man who is NOW YOUR PRESIDENT! remember? “I DID try and fuck her.  She was married.  I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn’t get there.  And she was married.  Then all of a sudden I see her, she’s now got the big phony tits and everything.  She’s totally changed her look.  I’ve gotta use some TicTacs, just in case I start kissing her.  You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful—  I just start kissing them.  It’s like a magnet.  Just kiss.  I don’t even wait.  And when you’re a star they let you do it.  You can do anything…  Grab them by the pussy.  You can do anything.”  — The President of the United States of America
These I D I O T S need to be REMOVED from office !   I'm so sick of the INCOMPETENCE and utter Stupidity from our (D)donkeys in charge.
This past weekend I saw on television footage of a woman marching against fascism and racial intolerance.  She was carry a sign that said, "White People Suck."  Which "side" do you think she was on?
What's an atheist doing "celebrating" Christmas???  Very hypocritical!
She is a cow and she is wearing a hat.  That's it!
To expand on Mr. Benson's comment?   Everyone is marching. You are a Nazi-flag waving, Confederate-hat wearing, Ann Rand reading, basement dwelling nitwit with more tea bags than common sense? Protest all you want. It's my right to protest right alongside you with my sign 'I'm with stupid' and an arrow pointing your way. Welcome to these United States, where we still have the right to call Nazi poseur dimbulbs Nazi poseur dimbulbs.   Protip: You can't show up to your protests armed with clubs and shields and guns and not expect the other side to ramp up to match you. Because of course we know with that stuff, you'll feel emboldened to escalate. Then you will blame it on the Violent Left. Well, be careful at those Nazi gatherings, because it's also free speech to say, "This nitwit showed up at a Nazi Klan rally. Do you know him?" and post your picture far and wide. :3
Mr. Philip, your column is both arrogant and stupid. The day may come in some future century when the world no longer uses oil for its energy needs but that day is not now. The demand for oil both in Canada and beyond creates an opportunity for jobs and prosperity for all Canadians. And Pipelines are the most environmentally safe methods of getting our oil to market. You provide no alternative method for this and ultimately that is what makes your article so stupid.
Wow!  You liberal Catholics sure are hateful!  Apparently you'd rather have baby murdering, anti-Christian, lbgtxyz-loving Hillary for president.
That's it.  I'll dress as a fat, balding, one-legged white guy.  No, wait -- that'll offend my wife -- at least, it seems to.
"President" Donald Trump is an apologist of neo-Nazism and violent racism.  He is un-American and an intensely disgusting person. He shames all Americans and soils American democratic institutions. His presence in government denigrates the nation.
Trump will be President. Too late to wring your hands.  Horse has left the barn. It's to late to put the Genie back into the bottle. You media, political insiders and power elite should have done something different decades ago. Media ruled and manipulated the news and never the truth. You helped created the anger at Washington insiders. The masses are angry and boiling and none of  you in media or political  power didn't see, want to see or care as long as your small  world was secure.  The rest of America was ignored until Trump zeroed in and took your control away. Now America has shifted to  who knows what. Media mouths and political powerful elite idiots kept adding fuel and stirring the simmering pot. It has boiled over now and  many will get burned before it's over. Look to your face in the mirror. You created your own hell.
Her husband is a rapist and pedophile not just a womanizer. HRC herself is also a womanizer and was uniquely responsible for threatening and bullying Bubba's rape victims into silence ....let me know if anyone wants citations ... there are millions!
The country's 'wealth'?  You think he is stupid enough to rely on this county's 'wealth'?  "On January 26, 2016, the US National debt held by the public was $13.62 trillion."   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac obligations are  excluded from that debt figure.  Guaranteed obligations, where the US 'guarantees' to cover losses like mutual funds, banks, and corporations are excluded from that debt figure.  Unfunded obligations like mandatory payments for programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.  are excluded from that debt.  "Wealth"!  Snort!
Fuck you cops! Try using some respect for people instead of brute force! You cops instigated the violence! Fuck you!
The MSM has for years gotten away of malignant name calling and fake narratives.  Republicans meekly turn the other cheek.  Remember the MSM always portrays republican presidents and candidates as idiots,  racists, bigots, homophobes, religious nuts mean greedy rich people.  Now someone dishes it back and the MSM are apoplectic.
You are a bastard. You made no effort to understand what I said. Go to the devil.
personally, i would prefer a diplomat with some intelligence, over a street fighter.  trump is ready to start a nuclear war over something kim said.  that is just STUPID.
' No, Trump ain't no star in any movie. .  Trump is just a traitorous, belligerent and childish buffoon.  (and a petty treasonous con man.)  . The movie was too long the minute the title played. .
The most sickening outcome from this theater is that yes, an audit will be done (but NOT the proper kind it needs), nothing will be found deficient, the dumbots in the capitol will give Krook Crapwell whatever he begs for, and the FRAUD will go on blissfully!!!  When someone so normally calm and reasoned as "bikemom" starts getting worked up and indignant at this charade, you KNOW something is UP and the fish don't smell fresh!!!!
This is gross trash talk at it's absolute worst. "Investmentwatchdog" cites "IWB" (I wouldn't put my name on this either) as the author of this unfounded spectacle of trying to cook up connections when there aren't any. How would you like it if I accused you of being a pedophile because I read it somewhere? This sordid and deprave post that reveals how desperate and grasping the trump followers have become. Who let the trumpanzees out?
Make sure that Comcast Spectacor takes all those damn cowbells with them.
Naive, recklessly confident of their non-skills, unrealistic expectations, plain ignorant!  This is preventable, especially in shallow, calm water.  Maybe the State need to require every tourist to be a card carrying trained snorkel diver...and of course, is able to swim.  Some people just don't have common sense...maybe a test on common sense on landing in Hawaii?
Trump is “hateful, racist and dangerous,” said Powell. This is why they are gathering to show their hatred for Trump, and show just how dangerous liberals can be when others dare to disagree with them.
Duke: Exactly my point. The unimaginative big money is sticking to old corrupt systems that are rigged in their favour. In 2008 the 800 billion dollars bank boo boo could have been solved by the government temporarily taking over the banks and just reselling them instead of throwing trillions at the very people that caused the mess in the first place. Infrastructure is one of the last way that big stupid money can indenture the next generation, besides student loans and over inflating assets like real estate. No surprise that Trudeau is push so hard for a public / private infrastructure bank. No surprise either that he got a standing ovation from a room full of Texas oil men.
Please make an example of these two idiots!
Dang, was just reading some of the angry-arse comments here.  There is no need to shoot children for god sakes!  They will face appropriate punishment, no immediate death penalty necessary.  Some people here obviously do not remember being young and stupid.
Oh...And one more thing:. You are the most pathetic individual I have ever interacted with.  Even more than GBA.   I share that view with many on this forum.
Against these ridiculous "bulb outs" but perhaps people need to get their lard a$$es out and walk a little more to get their precious manapuas...
Possibly the dumbest comment ever.
Miller ate their lunch and should have been the comm director not that Mooch jerk
An article critical of Reich's understanding of the economy doesn't change the fact that Trump is a liar.
And you are a moron.
Yes, but, why does the author not complain about Trump's a) threats to annihilate North Korea, b) threat of military intervention in Venezuela, c) threats against Iran and Syria?  I'd be more concerned about these than a stupid cartoon of a golf-ball hitting Hillary Clinton.  Too much criticism of Trump revolves around his (admittedly) appalling behaviour instead of Trump's/USA's foreign policy and the dangers that crazy foreign policy poses to millions of people around the world.
This is so stupid.  Everyone knows that cold Alaska is more suited for ICYBMs and that is where it most likely will go.
Thank gawd we didnt sign that fool, he got beat out by a rookie lmao!
Costs were already skyrocketing before the ACA.  The ACA just added the mandate that you have to fund it, and little else.  Trouble is the Repub solution wasn't working prior to the ACA, so why make the same mistake twice?  Face it..if you vote Dem or Repub, you're the problem, because neither of those are the solution.  Jeez...dumb big party sheep are killing this country....
The one good thing in this saga: the ugly American lost the round. We've had enough of these US companies. It's time we diversify.
Well, for starters I wouldn't be a complete idiot getting involved in an American election and taking brainless jabs at the bear and his supporters like a certain PM who thought the Piranha in the Pantsuit was a shoe-in for POTUS and ran his mouth off without thinking like he usually does.  Deservedly, Trump isn't going to do Zoolander any favors for his trashing during the election.  Zoolander only helped escalate our problem with his moronic jabs.  Bu there is the realization there is absolutely nobody with any skills with this gang that can't shoot straight so I guess bawling is the best we can offer until we turf these clowns and get a real government.
The President has a historic visit to Saudi Arabia to extend diplomacy and all you main media people can write about is this??!!!!! How pathetic!!!!!
Sorry you like I elected this loser....
"Except for the racial element" --- my friend, you just answered why your point is incorrect about my thoughts pertaining to the 1%. And, being a Right-winger, you can't claim anything related to anti-Semitism, considering that Donnie Moscow has inspired the white knights to claim that Jews and other religions—along with many ethnicities—do not belong in white America.  Your points about Bezos and crew are off-base. You name a few of the "good guys", when the vast reality is that many of them are nothing but hedge-funders like Robert Mercer—men with undiagnosed gambling disorders—or they are techbros. Techbros are white guys who pride themselves on being an asshole like Steve Jobs, only techbros don't possess Job's God-given talent. These are fellas who open-source meaningless apps, then hold an IPO to get cash before the public realizes how useless it is. And tech is legendary for hating women and being racist. The people you seem to idolize do nothing for America.
Here's a rap:  Yeah I think my daughter's fine - I'd date her if I could I love women everywhere  I grab them by thepusy  They don't respond, they think I'm crass I don't wait I just start kissing They're just a pieceofass.
The  RINOs are terrified of Moore because he will work to really clean out the swamp rats in D.C.   The man is fearless.  If this crap was true do you really believe it wouldn't have come out long before now?
Our feckless, useless Congressional delegation didn't just oppose or criticize Trump's budget...They SLAMMED it! WOW.  SLAM, BAM, WHAM!   The Star Advertiser, wholly owned subsidiary of FakeNews.com, is really trying too hard.
you are incorrect - millions will find a way. Stop pandering. We are not that stupid.
Comey didn't lose his job because of "credibility issues." If that was the case there'd be no one left in the Trump Administration including Trump.  Trump is just doing one more incredibly obvious, stupid thing in a lame attempt to save himself.
Your show of racism proves the cliche about when fool open their mouthes. Eight years, hahahahaha the man with the yellow possum oh his head won't last 2 years.
Your idol is as ignorant as his supporters who don't know the difference between hate and a hole in the ground. See you after the election.
Carl, go see Dr. Mika and Psycho Joe...go for a malignancy test, bring maxine and nancy with you...you all are obviously having this thing called TDS (trump derangement syndrome) manifesting itself on sore losers!
Religion is a protected class, just like sexual orientation. What you described would be illegal. It is really dumb for a business to refuse to take money.
another DRUNK and Trump who drinks doesnt want pot smoked by anyone
I've been sort of paying attention to this issue for a while, and being a dedicated jerk, my natural tendency is to think that maybe the students are just stupid ... but what about depression and lethargy, due to lack of sunlight during the winter months? Maybe your kids aren't stupid, but simply need sunlight, some vitamin-C? Maybe Florida does better because there is a lot more sunlight there? Alaska seems to have the most depression related events, and general feelings of not wanting to do anything during winter. Well, could poor grades be a depression and lethargy related thing? It would be an easy theory to test. Choose one school, install UV lighting, and see if grades improve. Maybe toss in vitamin-C supplements with lunches? Wouldn't cost anywhere as much as some of the other possible solutions.
The only thing more horrendous than electing Trumpy the Clown would be electing Hillary the Blood Countess.  And of course, that's what will probably happen.  Trumpy now tries to reassure the sheep after frightening them toward Hillary, hedging his bets; but I truly fear it's too late--the Blood Countess will ascend to the throne, and this will result in utter catastrophe for this nation, and the world.
Calling one closed minded for calling one foolish for calling one close minded who does not agree with you is recursively futile.
The Republicans cannot continue to enable Trump and allow his brazen ignorance and petty egoism to put people at risk. At a certain point, the good of the country and possibly the rest of the world must take precedence.
.  "Arab states rap Qatari reply to demands, refrain from new sanctions"  ---  That would be because there were no grounds for their original demands on Qatar, let alone new sanctions.  The Saudis and their three sheep got suckered by Russian fake news plants and are now standing in front of the world looking like idiots, trying desperately to save face.  The Russians knew that the Saudis wanted Al Jazeera TV (based in Qatar) shut down because it has an embarrassing (for the Saudis) habit of exposing the brutal practices of the Saudi (and Egyptian and Bahrain and UAE) dictatorships.  So the Russians planted some fake news stories about Qatar supporting terrorism and the gormless Saudis bought it, sanctioned Qatar and demanded they shut down Al Jazeera TV.  This worked for the Russians too as Al Jazeera exposes their crimes and those of their allies Iran and Syria.  Saudi suckers.  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/07/russian-hackers-qatar-crisis-fbi-inquiry-saudi-arabia-uae
Trump hate is really going to help Toronto thrive. Idiots.
If someone could tell me why nic's lies are considered civil, and my response not, I would appreciate it.    More abuse and bullying. I backtrack from nothing. I'm not afraid of you, your nastiness and twisting turns notwithstanding. Do you know Dylan's "Idiot Wind"? The lyrics are amazingly appropriate to how I feel about you.
They're will always be stupidity & greed.
tdm,, as left wings idiot
You are the last to be excoriating people for their words, RadirD. You are right up there always pointing fingers, blame and promoting divisiveness.  So - who is responsible here?  One of your troll compatriots blamed the left - of course.  I wonder what is wrong with you all the frickin' time but I just chalk it up to someone who has no morals, no love of America or democracy and merely wants to stir up hate. You don't stand on principle.  You stand squarely in the middle of the cesspool. And here you are lecturing the rest of us?  How absolutely pathetic.
I guess they decided to delete my original post. You're a bore, Northside, and no one cares for your post game analysis. We all saw or heard the game so are able to deduce exactly what happened. Stop trying to sound so prescient because you're . Frankly, you're a troll for the most part posting the same rubbish game in, game out.
Yep you are a racist
What a stupid, useless graphic.  Which neighbourhoods are which?
Why would you call people who turn right on red idiots as most intersection legally allow for?  I get tired of idiots who sit there paying zero attention to the task at hand - driving - until you honk the horn
If this scumbag is dead. It is the end of their diabolical Religion. He is their prophet and not suppose to die until the blood of Israel runs in the streets.  For all who followed this scumbag...you are cleared to eat pork and resume a life of peace with Jesus.
Poor Donald thinks he's under attack. The pathetic guy did his best impression of giving a damn, yet he doesn't think the left believes his sincerity.   Donald J. Trump‏Verified account @realDonaldTrump  1h1 hour ago  Made additional remarks on Charlottesville and realize once again that the #Fake News Media will never be satisfied...truly bad people!
she is almost dumber than patty murray please GO!
Never underestimate the stupidity of the Canadian electorate.
Guaranteed, these days when someone says, "With all due respect" it means "You're a fool for thinking you deserve any respect at all."
This is INFLUENCE PEDDLING and BRIBERY.  RCMP do your job to uphold the laws of Canada and charge this miscreant politician.   And by the way OPP, how are those FRAUD charges coming against Kathleen Wynne?   What a corrupted nation Canada has degenerated into under the Liberals, shameful and disgusting.
GROW a pair, Kymberly and just vote YES like the lackey you are.  So SICK of you pathetic, weak, vacillating politicians. NOT "leaders"....POLITICIANS.
I see that the DA has now scraped the bottom of their barrel of stupid, with Xanthea Limberg and her ANC like utterances! Since when is it NOT the relevant municipality/government's duty to supply it's citizens with water? Not too sure, but isn't there a bit in the constitution about "Basic Human Rights", one of which is water?????
The bottom 45% aren’t freeloaders, their actually parasites.
The vote was 6-3.  It was to grant cert, not to address the merits.  Who looks like the bigger fool now?
Alas, Mayor Lucy Vinis has turned out to be huge disappointment.   She has shown ZERO leadership, or initiative.   All she is doing is protecting the status quo, and is not doing anything to make Eugene's government actually better.  She is just another smelly Turd: a slimy politician that deserves to be flushed down the toilet.   I sure hope that the people of Eugene are not dumb enough to re-elect her to a second term.   4 years of her will be plenty.  She had zero experience in government before coming into office, just like Donald Trump did.   Why the public continues to elect clearly unqualified people to office simply amazes me.
It is beyond belief that the US has not taken his moron out already.  What the hell are they waiting for? Every day they allow this psychopath to continue breathing brings the world closer to destruction.
You could say the same for some of the comments from unnamed idiots on this site too.  However, if I offended you...I am deeply sorry for any grief I've caused you and will try my very best not to do it again.
That couldn't be more spot on.  My eyes are open.  These fools are BRILLIANT!!
What's the Anchorage record for continuous days with homicides?  We must be getting close to or setting a new record for that ... as we head toward a new Anchorage record  for total homicides in a year.  I grew up here, so I can clearly see that Anchorage sucks compared to decades past.  And the problem is simply too many stupid, lowlife people.  If you took away all guns, these people would kill just as many, with rocks and wooden clubs.
Please, enough hogwash.
If someone were to contact, they'd find out that I do teach 3rd grade. Diana Fyffe I know this is you pretending to be your former prostitute Chanda Lovett from your illegal prostitution ring you ran from your Duben Street apartment.  Stop making fake profiles to harass me with.  You are petty and your harassment is illegal and stalking, which is domestic violence and continued unwelcome contact.  Your rants are false and you couldn't be more incorrect.
The malignancy is the cancer of atheistic progressive collectivism that has eaten away the intellect and morality of Bernstein's mind and his ilk. The condition is akin to rabies in a dog.
Another sport ruined by the black plague.
True the odds of dying are higher on the Seward Highway, but the children are basically sitting ducks for the environment.  It's stupid to risk your kids over such an ego boost. . It's not about "knowing" what they are about, it's about what the action plan is if a rogue wave or other ocean travel problems arises.  The toddler is dead meat for certain, and probably many of the younger ones as well. . It's just plain stupid to take kids that young into a wilderness setting.  They are not self sufficient in an emergency situation.  What they are doing is basically sacrificing their kids at the first emergency that occurs.  STUPID.
"LOCK HIM UP, LOCK HIM UP" karmas' a bitch
Hillary is dumb as a door nail the woman never  knows what's going on!   Hillary your finished - go away now.
I get it Trump's a buffoon, but Polis represents arguably the most illogical, idiotic city in the state.  Consider the source.
At least "The Big O" (O'Leary) isn't claiming Trudeau had spies "wiretapping" the PMO before the last election. Bernier's campaign may be cheating? Tsk, tsk. Those darned "me first" libertarians without scruples!
The only person that's deranged here is you.  There's zero outrage about this on this thread.
And the moron you voted for just responded to this latest event by tweeting out a hope that China will do something about it, and then went golfing. He's being trolled six ways from Sunday and the idiot already played his entire hand. What's worse, is rubes like you think this is brilliant. When Seoul, and possibly Anchorage, are a pile of radioactive ashes and millions are dead, I'm sure you'll still be blaming Obama and chanting "USA!"
I'm a daily reader of this paper and instead of having to read even more articles about KO'L I would like to be served up analyzing articles about the other contenders to the PC party.  This is starting to look like false news - even if the G&M appears to be critical of KO'L they are still rooting for him.  This is obvious.  Again, it's like the US - cheering for a moron by avoiding to look at the alternatives.  It's  as if there is some higher, elusive power (semi fascistic demagogy) that shall be cheered on, regardless of it's lack of contact to the democratic electoral institutions as we know them.
The State owes Anchorage absolutely nothing. When you assemble another municipal corporation, it's to remove state jurisdiction, because your big enough to take care of yourselves.   Got any tax, or was that "Bong Hit's for Jesus" case still clouding the eyes of your great Juneau Assembly. When the bong hit's more important than a State, at least the old saying, always rings true...  "It takes a Village, to Elect an Idiot."
Do you know dumb that comment makes you out to be?
Why am I not surprised our one and only Johnnie Coghill is a Drumpf supporter? Here's hoping we can rid the legislature of this clown.
Barbara: We are being treated to a prime example of a doofus being "KITTY" whipped. The original idiot admits that it was his girl friend's idea.  What a wimp !
aa poor left loser lib troll of ottawa living off the public dime, cant stand reality coming back kicking the left out of office!!  better get your resume ready loser!! sanity is returning to canada!..
Wow! Some overview! How many stupid questions can a "journalist" ask and still give us an idea what they represent? On the positive side, I hope the remaining seated incumbents are shaking in their boots. 15 freshmen is a good start to cleaning out the Good Ol' Boys that are choking this state to death. I'm hoping it's the beginning of a trend...
I said I know them.  I didn't say they were my friends.  If your cousin was a ""higher up" dimwit who despised what was going on to the very end", why didn't he do something about it?   Knowing something bad is happening, having the power to do something about it, and NOT doing anything is being part of the problem.  Like you say, your cousin is a dimwit - must run in the family.
"...but now that Donald Trump is President the genre is essential, excoriating viewing". --------------------------- Just why is it essential viewing? I know Trump is an unbearable idiot so why would I need to watch a show mocking him? And to be perfectly honest, what sort of person derives their political information and opinion from a comedy show.   In a recent article, the son of Neil Postman wrote a column suggesting his father's polemic, "Amusing Ourselves to Death", predicted the rise of a figure like Donald Trump.  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/john-doyle-fixed-target-of-a-trump-administration-has-tv-satire-soaring/article33910624/comments/  But there is the flip side of Postman's prescient warning: those trapped in a television existence in which comedy becomes knowledge and the act of laughing at satire as protest - or worse - conceived as political action.
Yes, and Hillary has lizard blood.
Then, once Nixon's witch-hunt has been drawn to its sticky end, let's circle back and deliver a full blast of withering cosmic, social, and legal consequence for the pathological monsters who held our society in siege with their wrongful war for nearly five decades. The humanity. The loss. The harm. They must all be held to account. They must be made to pay. Adherence to cosmic justice screams aloud its demands that these Nazi-like scumbags must be made an example of that will echo forward through history and stand as a sordid reminder to posterity of what happens to false authoritarian monsters who take a knife and mutilate like psychopaths their own society for the advancement of dead ideology, political and cultural hatred and intolerance, and abject harm directed so very wrongfully against innocent decent citizens. There can be no peace without justice, there can be no justice without a full accounting and punishment delivered to the feet of these pathological subhuman monsters.
My god. I'm floored reading this. It's so mind boggling that someone could be so ignorant of the realities kids are facing today. "There are millions of apps for that". So I guess these apps write themselves now. My daughter is going to learn to code. And I feel much better about sending her into the world with those skills than without.
This is kind of a pointless test article. Just reject anything that defends Star Trek and you're golden. Besides, they'd just try to argue your computer into destroying itself along with the entire society because it's dumb and Kirk knows better.
I'm not "bashing" Obama.  It's your description.  I just point out the accomplishments, or lack thereof, in his case.  I do that for Bush too, like his stupid Iraq incursion.  Sadam had nothing to do with Al Qaeda.  But I will credit Bush for TARP.  Treasury Sec Hank Paulson was brilliant on that proposal.  TARP got 100% of the money back plus about $10 billion in profits.
It's pretty early in the morning for you to be stoned again. You can't possibly be that moronic, because you figured out how to turn on the computer.
Again MSM, it's all YOU. The floundering, a guide less compass, the envy and judgemental within your individual personality disorders, the herding of product, the plastic makeup and plagiarists, your unpatriotic value structure, your lack of empathy and finally your cumulative low IQ's. It's all your fault why people don't consume your loathsome product. The only reason to watch or read any further is for comedic value as The President of the United States of America continually punks your skinny bottoms. It's all YOU, now be good boys and girls and present yourselves for our amusement.
trump is a thin skinned child who is bent on undoing all things Obama without giving it any thought. He is not even 1/10 the man and president Obama was/is.   His brainless followers show how much they were duped every day.
If you want the dealers deported then youd better concoct a plan to be able to deport the fucking cops.
What a waste of time.   The Paris accords is all part of the globalist agenda to sell carbon credits and push the false global warming scheme now called climate change since global warming has not been occurring.  The  goal is to reduce the quality of life for the West to third world while elevating the third world countries to be on par with the new reduced quality of life for the West.  The ultimate goal is global control by the One World Order fanatics. Unfortunately  our political ruling elite have all signed up to promote this agenda.  Most are "useful idiots" wanting to jump on the train for their own selfish interests.
Karl,   The dustbin of history is calling.  Go forth and putrefy.    Please.
you are already a lunatic of stupidity
aa the lib troll of stupid, chris back spewing the paid talking point stupidity as usual, the us has social problems cause of left wing bs ,, trump is about to fix that.
And who the heck are they who only work about 1/3 of the time!  They are part of the problem!! They have no idea how to deal with a real leader...and he is just as big an enigma to the media !  Get used to having to suck it up and DO YOUR JOB ! ! !
More proof that the law is a 'ass' (ie a donkey....)
good riddance  to bad rubbish
Getting a ringing endorsement from Trump is like getting a report that the Muppets like the way your running the country. It could also be that mafia kiss of death. Trump is an obnoxious buffoon who needs a haircut and a lobotomy. His kids fill in for him when his hairdresser doesn't get him done up in time.
Indie, Indie, Indie..   I read your response twice because I thought I read it wrong the first time.  I was like.. "wait.. whaaAAaaaat?"...   Now I have a picture in my head of a dog sitting under a hanging lightbulb in a little interrogation room being question by investigators.  You silly goose!  :D
In six words:  Donald Trump is a pathological liar.
Hillary didn't lose Trump kicked her globalist corrupt rear end
Women make all the choices but sadly some of the choices aren't that great.  And sadly these women who make stupid choices expect us to pay.  Wake me up when it's 2019 or before if Junior "quits" or he's "fired".
If it were any city but Toronto I would say it was a great idea. But, its Toronto and the money will be wasted om idiotic projects that have nothing to do with transit or infrastructure. The projects will never come in within budget or on time  and the work will be contracted to the most incompetent contrctor with the highest political donations.  The clowns people elect won't even listen to City Staff so what do you expect?
This poorly run newspaper is expecting people to believe that Caldwell and his city clowns will control spending?  We all know how these clowns are poor stewards of our public money. Everything they touch is a disaster.
The Globe is so full of BS.    Are their really so many stupid people that believe these false SJW crusades?  I doubt it...does not matter to the Globe though.
And yet there is no accounting for the stupidity of the climate change denier.
Mocanic Get out your checkbook because Mat Su Borough believes in corporate welfare and economic growth without planning, zoning, taxing developers. There is no cure for hillbilly ignorant, corruption and apathy. I do quite well rocking the boat on a inept, broke Mat Su Borough Government that should be prosecuted for their actions. Higher Fees, Higher Taxes, overpaid inept borough staff. Yep nothing wrong in the Mat Su, just keep your checkbook open to pay for these Mat Su Government buffoons.
The Democrats are complete hypocrites in this case. In 2006 every Democrat from Obama & Clinton on down said he was a perfect choice. They just cannot forget they lost the election. They are just playing politics while the country struggles. Are there any adult politicians anywhere? If they had not rigged against Sanders they would have President Sanders. They shot off both their feet, in this case. Google has many references to the 2006 choice by the Dems.
The dumb LW2 failed to mention a very crucial piece of data: the age of her son. Was he 4? 12? Age makes a big difference. A four year old (or close to that age) calls things as they see it. Older children will say "You're fat!" to be mean. If this boy is very young, he may have just been innocently exclaiming an observation, as he would if he saw a big dog: "Your dog is big!"
Well that's a comment straight out of a Trump Rally.  Even I saw that one on the news.  Try to think like a big boy and come up with an original comment so we don't have to keep calling you an idiot.
Right now there are Somali children in Minnesota who are in hospital fighting for their lives because idiots like this convinced their parents not to have them vaccinated against measles. This irresponsible fear-mongering about vaccines has real world consequences, something Mr. Sullivan might want to think about while he sits out his suspension.
LIAR, LIAR, pants on fire .... the leafy suburbs get their lawns kept wet and green while the black locations have not a drop! Still living the APARTHEID NIGHTMARE, Ms Zille!
Perhaps that's a reason old liberals seem so scrawny and undernourished, but perhaps the veganism plays a role as well.
Rather than waste time on hopeless trolls I think I'll go outside today and enjoy a bike trail!  Thanks Cheryl!
Trump is the new God, in his messed up mind!
Well, the phrase, "Let the buyer beware" might also apply to newspaper ads. Everyday there are get rich schemes advertised in the newspaper, these ads would not be effective if the quote, "There's a sucker born every day" was remembered.
May I remind you, people, we are on islands!  You know mauka, and makai, Ewa to Diamond Head.  STOP!  This hi-risers for more tourist and vacation homes for the traveler is insane!  Any structure built along the multi-billion rail will be affordable housing for our growing local families...period!  If the plan is to build more condos and vacation rentals for the travelers of the world, I will personally dedicate the rest of my life to  lobbying  against these State and County idiots.  Amen!
I just talked about this on Twitter. Young liberals are going to like his "freestyle", but his actual fans, people that have been supporting him and paying for his music for 18+ years are 28+ year old white males. Mainly the demographic that voted Trump into office. He's going to lose half his fan base with this alienation. He's criticized Trump before, that's fine. But to say you have to choose and if you're hesitant then fuck you? What an idiotic move.  Eminem made me feel like it was okay to be different when I was in 7th grade and now he's making me feel betrayed.  I'm with you bro, F you too Em.
I know Faux News hasn't tried and convicted him; each day they painfully try to act like Frump is not a repugnant animal. Meanwhile the other news stations can't even be objective between Trump and Clinton because he's so outlandish in so many ways he sucks up all the oxygen being a predator and side show clown. 33,000 emails and Wikileaks...who cares. Let me know which date "the news media" handed down their guilty decision on Trumps antics.
At 7% of the market they are already crowding out food (farms and otherwise).  You think they can multiply that by 18 and suddenly never crowd out agriculture?    You are stupider than you already demonstrated if that's what you think.
State had a chance to make a difference.  Blame ICE/CBP  and lack of jurisdiction.  Don't by Hawaiian fish.  The will resonate through out the world. Native Hawaiians are right, this I not America  Sad and pathetic.  I attended the BLNR meeting.  Opportunity lost to begin the process of change.   Native Hawaiian deserve 20% of the price that the catch yields. That would give the Hawaiians a good start in obtaining homes and making a life got themselves.  Bring anybody to Hawaii without a passport or visa and just get a fishing license.  No trouble after that.... one can overstay as long as they desire.
Richard we're going to set the traps right in front of your front door that should stop you! U R A LOSER!
bahahahahaha! "Sustainability" You mean, "HYPOCRITES!" This state and city are so Leftists they love all things sustainable, the aina, global warming. Except when it comes to their own individual $$$! All pro-tourism all of a sudden. Disgusting. Grow a pair and live your (self-espoused) values and take a stand against tourism as a core industry! While we're at it calling out Leftsist Eco-nazis on hypocracy: why hasn't the entirety of the eco-loving population here demanded faster clearing of auto wrecks??!!! How much petrol is being released into the environment every time someone wrecks a car and our glorious police block all lanes or at most leave only one open?!
Not her personally, but the sovereignty fringe movement she supports, silly.
Don't be ridiculous.    I asked about personal responsibility, and most of the answers to my posts have avoided the actual question...including yours.
Clown ? His cabinet members are calling him a moron. Foreign leaders are calling him a dotard
Better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool than open it and prove the fact.
Your comment only displays your own ignorance.  Of course you have to make fun of Mr. Cole's view: it doesn't pander to your guy.  Poor Melania, married to a spoiled child.
if you have a mother who is a hag, surely
No, I would not agree with that at all.  Even apes, dogs and fish have social norms that they abide by.  You are an anarchist, not fit for society.
Celia your comments are off base and without merit. How long did you serve in jail to gain such knowledge anyhow?   And you can save me your sob story about collusion with the Nome judge when you where up here popping pills while working for Norton Sound. I've heard that story more then enough times over the years you've been posting on ADN. It's rubbish.
Moron.
What will they say next? That they were avoiding North Korean missiles? Maybe it's time give these two possible meth addicts a drug test.
Donald Trump Jr. got documents from Russian government at his 'waste of time' meeting.  Donald Trump Jr. has lied about every aspect of the meeting over, and over, and over. Even as more information has come to light, even with the release of the emails, he has still attempted to characterize the meeting as unimportant and a waste of time that “went nowhere.” Those statements also appear to be blatant, indefensible lies. And the information Veselnitskaya handed over, appears to be emails hacked from the DNC.  The whole of the Trump regime are treasonous traitors.   ( note to Trump apologists, …spin harder, very soon you won't be having any reason to be spinning at all.)
It's going to take an Alabama council person to do a state of Hawaii officials job. Weak and pathetic.
hey idiot the palestinians are the ones doing the bad treatments, israel is defending its self, get over your clear hate and ignorance
I honestly believe the President has mental issues.
Oh.  Poor sweethearts.  Too tragic and gory to read.  The sister will have nightmares for months to come.  Why did these two do such a stupid thing and depart from safety?  Are people that ignorant?  I've walked that boardwalk years ago and there's signs posted everywhere to stay on the boardwalk and be aware of animal danger.  RIP.
Dear Sick:  You are cursed with being good at this chore, and the rest of the family is happy to leave it to you.  If you can stand to leave the next job to others, let them handle it and don't be upset that they don't make a "proper" job of it.
Stupid is as stupid does. Did no one have a rational thought when they came up with this?
They look like garbage unless minimum wage part time is a the pinnacle of achievement for you.
The Americcan Catholic Church and the Pope are not the whole Church.  I agree this current Pope is a wacko doodle who is more concerned about Global Warming than preaching the truth.  But....the Eucharist and the truth of the CHurch is still there
Unless they are on salary I have found dentists to be greedy crooks.
That is a very big leap to assume the election was stolen. An arrogance worthy of the Democratic Party or Canada's Liberals. "They didn't vote for me, therefore they are stupid or the election was stolen". Never once has the Dems looked in the mirror and said "Maybe it was something we said or done. Maybe we wouldn't be on the outside looking in if we hadn't picked Hillary". I'm not saying you fit this mold NS Bill, but you are jumping to conclusions.
The US founding fathers were technically traitors too.  And the whole US was "founded on white supremacy and slavery", by the definition you used there.
Another commenter was observing that some people are either hypocrites or ignorant.  I have made similar observations.  The support for my argument and likely another commenters has been archived by ADN and is added to daily by those who comment after these articles.  If you want examples feel free to do the work yourself and go through the archives.  Don't forget to remove your blinders.
Get back on your meds, dead head
Bingo!  And these morons will gouge consumers for epi-pens and needed medications all in order to keep their golden parachutes sacred!
These clowns can't even handle homelessness, why would I listen to them regarding this? Maybe the plan needs more of what THEY'RE going to do, rather than us.
Moose too - damned moose and squirrel!
Hey AT, is Trump paying for the security at Trump Towers and Mar-a-Lago? Is he paying for his weekend getaways? Is He paying for AF 1 and Marine 1? BFD. His tax returns would reveal Trump is a dirty, corrupt bum. We all know that. You and all the "we" you claim to share a life with know it too, that takes only an IQ of about 70. Trump has loan payments to Russian Mafiosi. He owes more than he owns. If he were a Democrat, he would be in prison. Even for a troll, you aren't too bright.
how about we keep our borders shut until our own tech workers are employed idiot
Since there are no known situations of this that have happened in Anchorage, why has this become another Anch Baptist Temple/AK Family Action target?  This gets worse everytime this "FOOL" or this bunch starts another petition.  I'm sorry, but I have absolutely no use for this bigoted group.
Remains me of Bill Cosby. Perhaps more will name this guy as well. It's hard to accuse anyone of anything if you're not aware of what's happening. More people need to come out about this sick rapist.
Krugman is a loser
Wow, Harvard really showing the strength of their convictions and independent integrity. Pathetic.
Probably some Air Force Security Forces fucktard.
You are a disgusting racist and sexist man. The Taliban would love to take you in Lance.
wow you live in a delusional world bud, there are NO OIL SUBSIDIES!  man why are you left wingers so stupid. that myth was proven false long ago as the left wing idiots who came up with it were claiming oil was just not taxed enough as they think it should thus such were subsidies when clearly that thinking is a fantasy,, LIKE YOURS
Many felt a growing sympathy for Spicer, if not admiration.  Being spokesperson for an inveterate liar is no easy task.
Lol, listen to yourself... You are standing up for a President and his administration who, quite factually, attempted to manipulate the FBI /  Dept. of Justice to cover up their involvement in Watergate. We're talking about criminal obstruction of justice and a total abuse of power that was caught on tape, and you're totally cool with that.  Stuff that would never have seen the light of day had Mark Felt, and other sources (Felt wasn't the only one leaking information) not helped to reveal it. That no-good, POS leaker, Felt was revealing information to B&W, and other press agencies, because the acting director of the FBI at the time, a fellow placed there by Nixon, was deliberately suppressing and destroying evidence to protect the Nixon administration. What an unpatriotic bastard, amirite?
ha ha keep it up uneducated idiots. Making millions and they still complaining, do they required so much attention?
It's beyond me how anyone could still be supporting this inept and corrupt bunch.
Yeah.... I hear about crimes like this and while many are stunned at the evil in these people, I cannot believe how stupid they are to think they can get away with this crap.
"You make a lot of assumptions that are incorrect; first and foremost, that a meal provided by the government is going to be nutritious."  Eww eww eww eww eww eww.  Good Lord I bet your kids are monsters w/this kind of mindset you're showing here mister.    You're the only one ASSuming here mister.  Yuck!  FYI: Uncivil is displayed in many ways and it isn't always easy to pick up.  I would mark a big fat NO on civility if your comment had come up in my que ............cruelty is uncivil.  Selfishness is uncivil.  Meanness is uncivil.  Truth, although sometimes difficult to take in, is just sometimes needed to be said IN SPITE of pissing jerks off.  Deal w/it.  Listening2grasshoppers  If you don't like my comments then put me on mute.  You have a choice, right?  Little children DON'T YOU MORON
Gimme a break!  You guys are NOT nonpartisan.  Your liberal bias shows through in EVERY article.  Only a moron could read Civil Beat without being able to guess whether Civil Beat editors and reporters vote for Democrats or Republicans.  Why bother pretending?
Mr. Dalton:  I"m one of those "white liberals" who optimistically hoped the election of President Obama signaled movement toward "post-racial/racist" America."such a fool was I."  Instead, it opened the floodgates of racism as millions of "loyal, true, America-loving Patriots" attacked our President with every racist/xenophobic epithet known.  He was not just a "N#$%$#", he was a "N$#%$" who wasn't even born in America."    We now have a GOP Presidential candidate who openly parades his racism and xenophobia..and his followers love it.    I ask myself, "can we really elect such a man to be our President?"  Is the hatred and bogotry Mr. Trump's actions and comments have disclosed really OK with a majority of American voters? Do those who approve and support such a view really represent today's America?  I never believed a person like Trump could win the GOP nomination..I was so very wrong. Now I can't, in my heart, believe such a man can be elected President..I hope I'm not wrong again
It must be nice to have no shame. What Ivanka did to Toni Morrison's words is appalling. Apparently, like her father, she doesn't read, or waste a lot of time thinking about stuff.
This is an idiotic article. Top flight Canadian universities (Toronto, UBC, McGill, Montreal, Alberta) compete internationally to attract faculty, administrators, and academic leaders. We have two Canadian universities ranked in the world's top 35 (Toronto, UBC). Do you really think that's possible paying "public sector" wages?  Bottom line ... if we want world class universities, we need to pay competitive wages. $500,000 plus for a President is not remotely out of step with what the competition pays.
LMAO... MLB is putting on captivating  Playoffs..... while nfl Negroes  laugh and tell the folks who pay all the bills  to pound sand. Sadly, these illiterate racists are too stupid to realize what they are doing. Without White folks, Western Civilization, free market capitalism and America they're sitting on rocks eating bush meat.
A true waste of money. Coals to Newcastle. These programs work in areas where there are lots of tourists. Eugene? Dumb as can be….
Baldwin was not the one being goofy.
Wow!   Trump is such a narcissistic, lying buffoon who stoops to new lows every day.  I read about the solar panel proposal by the las vegas based developer months ago.   And now, trump is trying to take credit for it.   I guess we know where melania learned how to plagiarize ideas.
Wow, Tridentus.  You claim you are not a troll and then call me a heretic.  Thanks for proving my point.
Because he believes that his constituents are uninformed and he can get away with his transparent grandstanding? He is playing his constituents for suckers or worse but I hope most of the voters out there see through it.
Gee wiz what an astounding observation?  Of course the dumb, dumbos of the established GOP should be having a lot of sleepless nights after the performance they had done so far.  I just hope they all starting with mickey mcconnell, mad max maccain, pauly ryan when his turn comes up will lose in primary's to get rid of them.  If they had done and do half of what they said they would just maybe, they might still get to have more insider trading that makes them all millionaires.  Throw the bums out!
he ain't that young - just acts like it - the fool is closer to 50 than 40.
Your standard blah, blah, blah. A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
Now there is a pair of mugshots!  https://oregoncrimenews.com/cottage-grove-woman-arrested-after-leading-police-on-chase-through-eugene-springfield-which-culminated-in-3-car-crash-at-busy-intersection/  "No fool like an old fool!" comes to mind!
Dumb article. Most people also drive  their car during the week.  This doesn't apply to 95% of people. Who writes this drivel?
We're going to need it. After years of reducing health issues with effective anti-tobacco campaigns, we were stupid enough to replaced it with marijuana which is going to cause some of the very same health issues as tobacco.  Real smart of us.
Why are you so indignant over an "entitlement" from the government....that money has zero to do with anything you personally did/accomplished correct?  Heres a concept -  PAY YOUR OWN WAY....and why your at it get rid of these idiots insisting on giving the oil companies millions in free money.   That would go a long ways to fixing this mess.
The United States is the stupidest country in the world.
You'll get there someday....provided you keep your obtuse mouth shut.
Sounds to me like yet another piece of shit democrat is a seditious traitorous scumbag.  There is no such thing as journalism anymore, only leftist propaganda and fake news.  If you statist fucks bring down a legitimately elected President we the people will refresh the tree Thomas Jefferson spoke of...
aaa the bs excuse maker for corruption from a liberal hacky,,, this is NOT the system, its the system corrupt leaders put in place for thier pocket benefit... you agree but you are wrong, 1500 when you have many in the same room at the same time adds up to a nice pocket fill lib loser... bear in mind anything other than your bias liberal corrupt stupidity please
Well, you just got it.  Any ol' non-politician is better, right?  Let's see what we get from this non-politician: lies to buy votes, deficit spending, piling on funding for wars, garbage social programs with no fix in sight...hey, guess what?  That sounds like the typical big-party politician!   LOL  Next time, try voting one in who actually was self-made successful instead of born with a silver spoon in his mouth and is nothing more than an ignorant, spoiled loud-mouth.
I always try to judge politicians solely by their policy preferences.  On health care, Trump is a disaster. He wants to destroy that which exists without a replacement plan. That is a path to less availability for psychiatry and pregnancy care, two areas needed for societal health.  On guns, Trump is a disaster. He wants to reduce requirements for gun ownership and he denies that any new restrictive laws could be of benefit. He is a mouthpiece of the NRA.  On taxes, Trump is a disaster. His proposals are a road to benefit the top one percenters.  On the environment, Trump is a disaster. He is all for big coal in the midwest, a horrible pollutant.  On ethnic relations, Trump is a disaster. He advertises his policies with a loud singling out of criminals who are Hispanic or Muslim or foreigner or immigrant, while never singling out white folks.  He is the worst president of the past century based on policy. Anything diagnostic related to his brain, that's just bad icing on a bad cake.
Figures lie, and liars figure.  The naive State Legislators were "had"!
Randy Johnson 212 Let me deal with the only part of your reply I give a darn about.  Why do you, Slott, and the rest of the Fluorobots think you can come into our conversation, in our paper, about our water, and tell us what is relevant to that conversation?  Our entire conversation is most certainly about public opinion. It is about what we think should and should not be in our water. It is about what we think of you Fluorobots sticking your noses in our business. It is about telling you to go and peddle your poison somewhere else.  We do not really care what you, the ADA, Delta Dental, or anyone else thinks. We care about what the citizens of our area think. There was enough support in our community to vote a resounding NO! several times. The public's opinion of the Officials who ignored the votes, the purveyors of this toxic substance and those that continue to push it on our community is very important. The more you push, the more solid our stand.  Take your Fluoride and shove it!
More gratuitous cheap shots at Trump. It is, apparently, his fault that people are behaving badly towards politicians. Has it not occurred to Mr. mason and other msm journalists that perhaps Canadians from coast to coast are just as tired of being lied to and ripped off by the progressive, know everythings in government as their American counterparts? Governments have become too far-reaching and intrusive and constituents are just tired of taking it lying down. Yes, it's easy to spout off on social media and certainly easy to hide behind a fake account but at the end of the day it is pure frustration at work. To suggest we were all saints before President Trump was elected is pathetic and nothing more than cheap, lazy journalism.

The politicians are whacking out the aina on Oahu and these clowns dont say nothing. Hypocrites
Hell with the NFL. Play players that respect our flag, our country and our anthem. If not, we do not need them. Join ISIS, ANTIFA, BLM, the democrat party. Get off the field and crawl back in your hole LOSERS!
Bernstine is trying to relive his 20 minutes of fame he got for reporting on Nixon. What we have is a obtuse politically polarized media he should not be so big a fool not to realize it for what it truly is.
no idiot, trump isnt proposing he set up some government run bank for private money, the liberal way of slush funds for friends as usual
Stupid premise.  But slagging Trump is the surest route to getting published in this rag.
Trump seems mentally ill.  His incompetence also disturbs us.  He exudes weakness underneath his shibai and bluster.
I can provide a long list of "studies" that "demonstrated" all sorts of things that are now discredited.  For your information, correlation does not constitute causality.  Your script is fairly simple: "Really insightful, smart, and enlightened people like me favored the candidate who lost. Therefore, everyone who did not favor my candidate was benighted, stupid, and unenlightened."  You can then fill in the blank with the epithet(s) of your choice: racist, sexist, homophobic, antidisestablishment, etc., etc..   Thus spake Joan Chittister and thus speaketh you.  Of course my impression is predictable - you're red concentric circles on a white background.
Obama is a weak coward.  He will remembered that way.
if the lunatic fat man in NK fires one that hits the usa ever, the usa wont just act they will take the north out!
Add to that the millions of Canadian taxpayers frucked over by Trudeau and his ship of fools
"Is President-elect Donald Trump so thin-skinned..."   Uh oh...is he a snowflake?! *gasp, sos, wahh*     Perhaps 'flake' is sufficient enough in this instance.
Comments like this make it really hard to stay within the "civil" boundaries of this forum.  You're so out of touch and just plain... ridiculous that you make it very hard.
So car and truck sales are at record highs the past few years....people take 5-8 year loans on those vehicles because they're too broke to pay cash...and in 1-2 they will all sell them and buy electric cars....are you from BC and stupid or just one of them? LMAO!
Another ignorant paranoid hillbilly.
And these two are the best that came to the top. in our system.     Garbage floats, after all.
Damn you Alaska!! Every time I find a place I like, it goes away! RIP Sub Zero!
Just when? Will we get rid of this bunch of corrupt, evil, destructive thugs, who pretend, to be ruling our country? Kindly explain to us, desperate South Africans,  just what, exactly,  is an  'ANC  Conscience'? And why,  are we unable to just kick them out,  bigtime,  instead of waffling about,  while we descend into complete destruction.  Catch a wakeup,  fellow Saffies!!!
Pollution EXISTS, that is not a joke - the fraud is that we are being told to pay for them to continue while they can create shell companies and dump MORE toxic waste in waters/lands and in our backyard - literally.  if you think the bombing non-stop for years in countries is not cooking the earth, then you are severely stupid. They are not using perfume as bombs.
What kind of dullard would mark this as 'funny'..?
He knew the hearts of men/women.  MSW and WALFORD don't.  It's these "don't judge judgers" that drive the rest of the world nuts.  They don't see their own hypocrisy!!!!
Its ironic that a country which colonized half the world complains about immigrants! If India had only voted the Bastards out!  Imagine being an educated 21 year old UK citizen this morning, realizing how your future prospects in the region have gone in the crapper while watching xenophobic 60+ year old retired rubbish collectors with 10 years left to live waving Union Jack flags.
It's a good thing opinions from people like you don't matter in the real world. You're just a classless bully sitting behind a desk picking at people who are more successful in life than you. For every person who has a distasteful opinion there is 100 people who can see the talent and drive this young man has.
my young child pointed to a woman and teased, “You’re fat!” ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Fat woman: "I can lose weight. You, on the other hand, will always be ugly."
Trump is such an opportunistic a-hole.  What an idiot.
Walker is the head cheerleader for wanting part of our PFD . He needs billions to get his gas line built and can't get the money any other way.  Special interest groups also want part of the PFD for their own programs. Unions want part of the PFD to give money the state doesn't have for member raises .   Never forget---once legislators and Walker get part of your PFD and impose taxes on Alaskan's , they will NEVER give them back , even after oil prices go back up , as they most certainly will.   Tell them NO---keep your darn fingers off our PFD's !
Seriously Dean, do you have a job? Pay taxes? Pay for health insurance? What exactly is so great about the democrats and the previous 8 years? What is so malignant about a guy that speaks his mind and has made billions and employed thousands of people of all races and creeds? Do you really believe in: Obama Care? Higher Taxes? Unemployment at 8+%? Food stamps at an all time high? Benghazi? Boston? Ft. Hood? Orlando? San Bernardino? Need I say more. Shut up fool!
Considering the seismic upgrade would have been such a small proportion of the final cost, I think it's a case of being penny wise and pound foolish. I also think the City Council missed a golden opportunity for setting an example that the "big one" is a threat to be taken seriously. Residents of Eugene and other NW areas should be encouraged to protect people and property by investing in seismic improvements and votes like this are discouraging and ignorant. I See this as a missed opportunity.
And furthermore, city council, our governor is a traitor. Any thoughts on that you would like to share?
Siemian and the entire offense was pathetic. The pick six was one of the interceptions that lost us the game. I would start either Osweiler or Lynch soon so we can try to make a playoff run.
I have compassion for the murky waters... it can't be much fun to be a republican with half a brain these days.
Ramaphosa are a racist & we don't want a corrupt man to lead SA.
I don't think anyone is afraid of different values-unless your values , DICK, are wearing a hood at night , working the police force during the day and just plain being a prick. Not all white people are racist, I know, but I guarantee a shit ton of them have just sat by , watching ...........privleged.
You are an ostrich! Trumpism is all about white supremacy!
Seriously assault?  If someone shoots you in the knee cap one time that is assault.  Multiple shots all over the body is not assault that's attempted murder.    The charges are almost as ridiculous as the situation.  Trigger happy idiots are as commonplace as the Internet nowadays.  I truly miss the days when folks had common sense and when situations or altercations could be handled with fists rather than guns.  (No words aren't always enough, but people are more likely to survive a fist fight than a shoot out, a lot less likely to injure innocent bystanders as well)
Teachers are a lazy useless lot with massive entitlement issues just like the useless liberal overpaid government. Fire the teachers then toss Mitzy hunter.
This is a loser.  It is NOT a Muslim ban.  83% of Muslims live in other countries that were not banned.
Whatever the idiot in chief touches turns to crap. What General Kelly needs to remember is that if you hang around crap too long you get immune to the smell. You need to leave before you can't tell the difference between a fragrance or a stench.
"No one wants to say that we are benefiting from someone else’s misfortune, but we’ve seen a big pickup ..."  But you'll go ahead and say it anyway. Sick.
More Cassy nonsense.
Articles like this is reason most people do not believe what they read!  Why not include all the tax loop-holes the super rich enjoy?  Why not include the TOTAL income the super rich enjoy?  Why not have a few pics of the places where the super rich live, multiple place no doubt?  Mitt Romney is a prefect example of the super rich enjoying all these breaks and outlandish lifestyles while crying "poor me".  Who believes the super rich cry babies?  Only fools...
Stupid post of the day, you mean?
There's no fix for stupid
Hey you  wormy old fool, still suffering from Trump derangement syndrome?  My advice is to get over it and move on.
Children not harmed .. Mentally I'm sure they were terrified, that's some permanent harm as far as I'm concerned... Gutless piece of feces that would do that with children in home , let alone try n kill someone over chump change..!
Well Mr. Trump did continuously claim during the campaign that the election was rigged.  He just forgot to note that it was rigged in his favour.  No wonder he is hiding his head in the sand.  How long until this clown is impeached?
The Republican Party is tripping over themselves trying to distance themselves from the Alt Right. It's all lip service. The Aryan Nation Party (GOP) pitched a hissy fit when the Obama administration tried to put white supremacist groups on the terrorists watch list. It is the their white trash president that for more than eight years demanded to see President Obama's birth certificate. It was their white trash congress that obstructed at every turn, even denying President Obama's Supreme Court nominee for nearly a year. It was because he was the first Black President. No the Republican / Aryan Nation Party owns this. No amount of lip service will suffice. It is time to call out the entire party. The entire Republican Party, every single Republican voter all the way up to the party heads, has the blood of this weekend on their hands.
Dammit, Monica, you had me til the second-to-last sentence.  But Happy Thanksgiving anyway.
Hilarious...Trump's brain came from Breitbart, the worst fake news website on the Internet.
Get your facts straight! The media, including you, suck! All you want is a story..truth or not. Pathetic! These are peoples lives youre reporting on..you should be sure what you say are facts. If only someday you have such a tragedy in your life, maybe then you'll understand how  heartless you've been
you're starting to get goofy again tommy
What a bunch of crap this person has put out - it is the stupid democrats holding up everything - they are a bunch of  crybabies because they lost the election and want they now want to destroy this county.  His agenda would be great if they would stop fighting to try to discredit him and listen to why he was elected in the first place.  Do away with all democrats and the US would be a great place
Just shoot me now. This is so NOT what Canada needs: it's own version of a failed businessman turned reality TV "star" who is an obnoxious, pompous, self-absorbed, bombastic, egotistical, professed know it all. Like Trump, he is a charlatan and a fake. If we end up electing a mini-Trump like O'Leary, I don't know where I will move to.... Scandinavia?
Like all of psychotic Trump's criminal appointees, Scaramucci is a criminal and a national security threat. Trump is one hundred percent a psychotic criminal, he's completely crazy and a raving madman. When those crazy personalities seize power they kill lots of people. Remember Hitler and Stalin? How about Idi Amin or Pinochet or Pol Pot? Trump is exactly the same as them, if you broke down Ted Bundy's personality you would get Trump.
Stupid article.  Obviously the military can not be used as police.  They are incapable and incompetent.  There should be no military forces in any of the occupied territories, and Israel should simply withdraw.  That is what the law requires, and all consequences from an illegal military occupation are due to the military, not the civilians.
The constitution is a 'traitorous criminal'?  Get a grip and grow up.
The PC atmosphere in this country is getting us killed. It's time to stop this pathetic nonsense.
Which has what to do with what I posted? Please elucidate us more ignorant?
Dumb
It didn't mention anything about the ageing of the men in the country and the loss of so many young to wars and other stupidity. Maybe it's the new low cut jeans so Levi manufacturers can save material and charge more for Relaxed Fit and so having to wear them around the waist tightens the crotch and beer bellies don't help. Maybe it's why there are getting to be so many trans genders, who knows but the birth rate causing more women to be born then men will show up in the evolution of politics in the country and in the military.
Hypocrite. Next time you got to any big box retailer you"ll come out empty handed if you are looking for something Made in the USA.
Your non-comment couldn't have been dumber!
Many digital cameras store their serial number in the meta data of the photos they take. If someone steals your camera and uploads photos from it to the internet, you can find those photos using this website: http://www.stolencamerafinder.com/  Sorry to hear about the theft. Hopefully they can get their stuff back. And please try to keep in mind that most Alaskans are not thieving bastards.
Wait - let me be sure I understand. The press is biased, but you are not? Do I have that right? What hypocritical drivel!
"Narcissist in Chief"?  If that's a reference to Trump, then a vote for Tulsi would be a vote for "Narcissist in Chiefess"!  And a "No More Idiots" petition?  I thought that would be directed at Tulsi!  But I also thought that Tulsi's reach exceeded her grasp, and we now know that didn't stop Trump.  She's president in her own fantasy and, unfortunately, in those of the people who voted for her, even those who couldn't stomach Mufi, Kreepy Crawley, or that last whack job.
907AK is a troll and doesn't care about improving Alaska by making sure my pipe gets laid
Bernstein is a leftist fool, but an expert at malignant reporting.
You are missing the point. We don't want politicians - They are idiots and criminals. (#1 profession for people with a criminal record? Politicians and a documented fact)    Since it is the political class that is destroying our country we want business people who can run a business.   Canada is disappearing down a shthole in debt an malinvestment and massive new strategies are required. The political class is too stupid, greedy, or on the take from the elites to fix this  Get it yet?
Who cares!? Stark trek and Star Wars fans are all dorks who never get laid.
You're wasting your time with bsprotection.  He's stuck on stupid. No cure for that.  I think he's got rat lungworm too.  Screws up the brain.  No cure for that too.  Give him some sympathy.  He'll feel better.
"I find it interesting that many posters here decried the name-calling of President Obama and Clinton.... ....but have no problem with calling Mr. Trump names like "President Moron" and other nasty plays on his name.  Can you explain this seeming hypocrisy?"  With ease.  Obama and Clinton are superbly qualified to be president.  Trump is a failed businessman and "reality" TV gameshow host with no experience of any meaningful kind.  Furthermore, Trump is a confessed sexual predator as well as pathological liar.
Way to funny.  By the way just got back from the jerk store...
No such thing as eliminating traffic deaths. Another idiotic waste of city money up there with the sanctuary city scheme.
Jay won Wavemaker...quit showing your ignorance.
How about getting on Montreal for dumping their raw sewage into the St. Lawrence. Hypocrites!
We need far higher standards of training and responsibility before letting just any idiot buy guns.
It takes a certain degree of idiocy to agree with David Duke about our presidential candidates.
Rubbish. Check Trudeau's elbows.
The definition of a nihilist is "a person who believes that life is meaningless and rejects all religious and moral principles."  And yet he shouts stupid,  racial, religiously-charged nonsense at innocent teenagers.  This man is a raving lunatic, BY CHOICE. And a very stupid man at that. Having pity on this fool, Jeremy Joseph Christian, is an attack against humanity and love for our fellow beings.  Although the current toxic political environment can be blamed and placed at the feet of a majority of politicians, this monster must be held accountable.  He should not be given ANY public forum to spew his hateful opinions but given a fair trial and a burial at sea just like Osama Bin Laden
The only fool that Trump is making is of himself and his supporters. Republicans are in total control of Washington yet he hasn't a single legislative accomplishment he can point to. In the first 8 months of his Presidency, Dotard has had 19 (NINETEEN!) members of his administration either resign or fired. Dotard said that "healthcare would be easy" (how's that "repeal & replace" coming along?), Dotard also said reining in the N Korean's would be easy also but after meeting with Xi Jinping said “After listening for 10 minutes, I realized it’s not so easy,”. Dotard also said that building the wall that Mexico would pay for was going to be easy. How's that wall coming along? Then just today he said "he would not rest until Puerto Rican's are safe" as he boarded Air Force One for yet another taxpayer paid for golf trip (24th or 25th golf trip?) to his club in New Jersey. The list goes on and on and you Trumpkins still foolishly support this obvious liar and con man.....
Trump ran as a racist and a fascist, and it was precisely as a racist and fascist that he was elected president of the Unites States.  No-one can be surprised that he's in the process of forming a racist, fascist government.  Still, having said that, what you post here is chilling.
How do you reach such a ridiculous conclusion? SMH!
So, take offence at the headline, Duke.  I'm with ya, on many occasions.  But hey!  Hold off on THEN attacking the article itself.   Yellow journalism? That tag usually is applied to "news stories" not opinion pieces (which this is).  In any case, cool yer jets. It's just a column with a stupid headline.
I love how Randy Ruedrich and his main squeeze both contributed to Nick Begich's campaign on March 24.  Them darn liberalz and their tree hugging contribut......oh wait.....
These hypocritical A Holes that are grilling her are cut of the same cloth that are now pressuring Tokuda to cave in to mayor Krookwell and extend taxes FOREVER???   Yeah...they have TONS of credibility and ideology
There's an old saying about blind pigs finding acorns.  Maybe Trump stumbled on a good one in Kelly.  If nothing else, the law of averages is in Trump's favor.
You appear to be a troll that votes, keep up the good work. Keep fighting the good fight.  Best regards
I can not look at Paul Ryan anymore without wanting to wretch. He's even surpassed the Donald on my wretch list.
Take some Quarters and call Some one that gives a darn!
Take a look at the waistline of Alberta's "fat cow" health minister. By the way I am one of her "sewer rats".  My previous comment of a simmilat nature was removed which means it is okay to call people "sewer rats" if you are a socialist politician but not to call politicians "fat cows" if you are a conservative - the hypocrisy stinks G&M.
Your comment is despicable.  It's easy to insult and impugn the honor of a retired army officer when hiding behind a pseudonym: in fact you sound like a horrible amoral coward.
He's not a "good immigrant" Allie, he's an illegal alien.  No matter how you spin this, the guy is still here illegally.  Like putting lipstick on a pig......it's still a pig.
A man who claims he is not like other humans, that he is above temptation, is not only dangerous and a fool, he is not telling the truth.
Good.  At a bare minimum, a move as bold as taking more than half of each Alaskan's dividend should require a vote of our cowardly legislature.
If the past is anything to go by, I predict the EU leadership will make corrupt and vindictive decisions while acting  like a bunch of sanctimonious jerks, and ultimately end up with egg on their faces.
I’m mad at Hillary for not follow the rules and getting her private server hack and possibility costing lives and lying about it. Also I’m mad the DMC is just as incompetent. Next post try to keep the macho “be a man crap” out of it Michael, it’s the internet and anybody can act tough behind their computer, it makes you look pathetic.
He has no mandate and has no intention of talking to anyone but leftist communist loons to reinforce his own idiocy.
What a stupid statement. He's the boss it's up to him to see they don't!
Maybe you didn’t understand...agricultural and domestic workers, mostly black, were EXCLUDED for Social Security...so of course they didn’t pay the taxes because they COULDN’T. I’m giving you the benefit of the doubt by suggesting you didn’t understand, and so made one of the most stupid comments I’ve ever read here.
The GOP (Grand Old Pricks) still haven’t the guts nor the integrity to throw the book at that racist Drumpf with hundreds of dog whistles hanging around his neck; decorations for America’s modern-day Dr. Strange-glove (between a woman’s legs), a man with Nazi DNA in his blood, a stupid, stupid little man, because the GOP is a racist party. This madman with intent bordering on psychosis and steeped in his appalling hatred for African Americans and anyone who isn't white attested by his long history of racist bullying, who will do anything to tear to shreds the the many advances left by his predecessor, Barack Obama.  To those who have normalized Drumpf over the past two years and more, you’ve made your bed and now you must sleep in it.
Fool! they are just going to build apartments on top of it in 3 years when they get hungry for more $$$.
Zinke To Carve Out Exception For Home State On Shrinking Monuments  Zinke is all in with Trump's wish to sell off our public lands and parks to corporate exploitation and destruction.  Except in his home state where he's asking for more parks and more set asides of public lands.  But then again, Zinke wants to keep his home base happy so they'll support his future political endeavors.  Just another grifter and huckster.
whites & their corrupt boss Johann Rupert. We'll not let their stooges to rule on us.
Forget it Mike. Rachel  has posted some pretty nasty comments.  Trumpists are the biggest complainers and hypocrites on the planet. Don't lower yourself to their level.  Contact ADN if you want to file a complaint about harassment from flaggers.
what a loser.
Just like Home! When you too stupid to vote; STAY HOME. http://alaskareport.com/news/z49999_corrupt_bastards.htm
Stupilla more like.  Never mind the rescues, where's the arrests for underage drinking, public drunkeness, littering, and being stupid?
This goes way back to Avro Canada Ltd when it developed the Avro Jetliner (Avro C-102) and of course the Avro Arrow (CF-105). US government/ industry machinations and Canadian government foolish myopic actions killed them both. Canada still is paying the price.
I expect as much silence on this as they had on tRump's p***y grabbing tape. The left tends to have principles on this - witness how they reacted to Weinstein vs. how the right reacts (meaning, virtual media silence) to O'LIElly, Murdoch and pResident P***grab.   Remember: tRump was caught, on tape, BRAGGING ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT. And they still voted for him.   Anyone that watches Faux and voted for tRump is a flaming hypocrite if they only rear up on their hind legs and start bleating about Weinstein now. Remember, O'Reilly's sexual harassment was known about for more than a decade, at least for anyone not deep in denial. He's not called Falafel King for nothing.
This is the most disgusting part of Trudeau's immigration plan. I cannot believe a Khadr is not on a terrorist watch list.
Trump pulled Gillespie down into the cesspool, but the voters of Virginia have obviously had more than their fill of Trump.  Trump is a racist, white supremacist sympathizer and imbecile who has been a complete failure as president.  He has accomplished nothing except to rile up his base of bigots.
Tar and Feather that Dumb FUGLY Nigga!!!!!!!
Don't give the troll, Parrot, any patriot recognition.  S(he) probably never served a day in the military, or developed any ideas of patriotism.
your ignorance is a betrayal of reality, see fox NEWS is truely non bias,, fox opinion shows are not..
Nothing was more disgusting than the obsequious Peter Mansbridge  kissing Trudeau' feet and almost sucking on his toes.
"We can fix education. But this takes away any motivation for us to.”  What is WRONG with Republicans?  First, there's the existence of a clear and pressing problem with WA education.  Why is that not "motivation" for Republicans?  Then, there's the knowledge that our State is in violation of our constitution  -- which would count as "motivation" for any sane legislator  --  and the whopping daily fines the legislature has signed us up for as a reminder.    But now they're saying that our kids must actually be harmed in order for them to do their jobs?  I say, let the right-wingers screw around till the cows come home  --  which they clearly want to do  --  but at least let this stopgap bill pass, so our kids don't get mangled in this stupid, pointless ideological fight.
you are the willfully ignorant , you refuse to accept our local style and denigrate it as stupid.  just because we don't agree with you demeaning assertions that we are all stupid.  nope, it is you who is.   but, please don' reply to me, like I said, stupidity irks me.
Allie, you are the disgrace. You call yourself an American? Who are you working for,  Putin, Pelosi, Soros, Schumer, Schatz, , Chin, Ige? Trump is the President. If you don't like it move. And take your tripe with you. Aloha.
He jumped from the bridge! He's an idiot that should be charged for the cost of the rescue!
What a piece of shit.
The "useless council" was put together by your "useless Chump". Guess your useless head didn't figure that out.
Why does Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama remind me of a newborn sewer rat every time I look at him? I got it. He looks like a rat (butt ugly), and he's pinkish…yelpers boy howdy.
What does the monkey from Kenya know about the arctic? NOTHING PERIOD The thing this ape has done is stir up trouble around the world and what he can not do old Hillary Rodham can do, two nuts in a bag.
If your getting your  news from Postmedia no wonder you think there is nothing being planned by our government. Sad. Failing. Dumb!
.  "Intercepted Russian communications part of inquiry into Trump associates"  -  Trump and his cronies are dirty.  You can smell it.  He and Vladimir Putin, the greatest thief in history, are a matched pair.  Well, except for the thirty-IQ-point advantage that Putin has over Trump.  Otherwise....twins separated at birth.  They must have come from the same gene pool, though Trump came from the shallow end of the pool.  .
Why would I spend 60 bucks to hear someone speak, much less share a meal with, about current Democrat thinking?  Why would I risk barfing up my meal in the presence of someone who is supposedly educated and most likely supporting the most corrupt, dishonest Presidential candidate in modern history?  WHY?  The Democrats running for office should run away from the embarrassing disgrace of Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Well put, Rita. The concept of making reparation is a good and healthy one. But a big room with cleansing fires, although not quite as hot as the flames down below, is clearly ridiculous.
Pompous fool!
Guidance from Trump?  Good luck with that.  It may not be a good idea to wait for guidance on healthcare from a sociopathic imbecile.
Mr Trudeau has the right to be arrogant, Canadians love him no matter what.  This is a man who right off the hop was outed for charging charities for speeches (a decent man would have donated his time) and, after a half-hearted mea culpa, Canadians ignored this indication of character and gave him a majority.  I applaud him for recognizing he's a charmer that Canada will always take back no matter how unfaithful he's been to us.  Anyway, the Ethics Commissioner is an appointment so the whole thing's a joke, he's the one who determines her fate - and Canadians and their lapdog msm think this will be a real probe.  Hilarious!
hahaha!!!  WHAT A TOTAL SMACKDOWN by AG Jeff Sessions of the impotent, delusional, idiotic, purile, foolish dems on that committee!!!  Correct me if I am wrong here, but in order to have an investigation you have to have something to investigate!!!   There is ZERO evidence after 10 months of "investigating"!  Yet there is NO INVESTIGATION as said by Crazy Comey 3 times!!!  The Head of the FBI, NSA, CIA all have said that the "Russians" did not change even one vote!  Crazy Comey said three times UNDER OATH that Trump was never being investigated!  There is NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER to be found, and Crazy Comey leaked his fake "feelings and ESP-thoughts" as "evidence" to the press, all against the law as per 18USC641!  Bottom line:  Sessions just kicked their collective okole's up there and made complete fools out of all of them up there on the left!  It reminded me of a papaya getting run over and smashed by The Bus!!  You dems are the funniest critters on the planet!  haha!  CLASSIC!
Maybe the NFL will fold up like a dirty diaper, since they'll a bunch of cry babies.
In our current society this article doesn't surprise me at all! We have created an anti-nurturing environment for our youth, a disconnected and self-absorbed environment that is not child or family friendly. Keep your families and children close people and beware of anyone you let in your lives. Fight for your children and let them notice so they learn to fight for themselves! As to you anti-violence idiots that are same category as anti gun people I have some advice for bullying. Bullies will always be there and they always have!! It's called the 3 step rule. Rule #1 is tell the teacher, parents and adults what the situation is! Rule #2, if the teachers and adults/parents don't resolve the situation than give fair warning to said bully in straight terms. Rule #3 if said bullying doesn't end than knock them on their ar*se! I might get some hate for the above but it really does work.  This article has.. unbelievable, so heartbreaking..
Thought we created a Progressive Utopia where firearm deaths were a thing of the past after the genius DemocRats enacted their stupid laws.....
Seriously Andi? Practically deserved? So its the small businesses fault and not the damn thieves fault? Give me a break
You're not just clueless, you're criminally stupid. Read this report, idiot, and then tell me that more investigation shouldn't be done?   https://publicinterestlegal.org/files/Alien-Invasion-II-FINAL.pdf
Helpless, poor and mentally ill? You forgot drunk.
dicktator elect Donny SHITLER tRump will destroy america, thanks to you shitheads!
"Stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio and television and the internet. To hell with them. They don't want anything done for the public good. Our incapacity is their livelihood."  Why does a guy have to wait until he's terminally ill to have that epiphany?  And will any of the rest of them listen?
What a bunch of pure jingoistic nonsense, beating the Cuba deadhorse, should have been broadcast in black and white.
Ann Kobayashi is so out of touch with reality it's pathetic.  If she thinks giving the homeless free food will cause them to "...shift their limited finances toward housing or other necessities...." she has really lost it.   Might as well feed the feral cats.
Yup.  This is a win-win for us IMO.  If Boeing persists, we shift gears to the F35 which is not a bad change.  If they don't, they drop the Bombardier nonsense and give us a good deal on some super hornets.  Win-win.
I laugh when the ignorant tell me: "America is a Christian nation." Not just because Hebrews 11:13-16 KJV plainly states all Christians confess plainly they have no nationality, but also because the 1st amendment legalized devil worship. I have the right to worship your Satan.  PC liberals are the 21st century version of the 16th century Puritan. They want to burn witches. Anyone who disagrees with them is a witch.
Thank you MADD!  Why aren't more people taking this seriously?  Why would Everett's Police and Firefighters, many of whom having seen the tragic and horrible results of drunk driving accidents first-hand, endorse a candidate that would willingly and selfishly choose to put the public safety at risk in this way?  Drinking and driving is completely unacceptable behavior.  The fact that he has overwhelming support from the folks who are charged preserving our health and safety is simply ridiculous.
Wait for it... here comes da tweet with the words loser and low ratings.
These clowns have no idea what to cut. They just continue to post talking points as if they know what they are talking about.  These are the same group of individuals who favor cutting the fire department and then go ballistic when there is no respondents to their house fire or medical emergency.  They pretend they never drive on a road maintained by the DOT, have no need for  commercial fisheries management,  etc. They will tell you everyone is overpaid and private contractors always save money over government operated anything.
You're a coward who's afraid of getting in the arena so you stay in the stands where it's safe and throw bombs at the competitors in the arena. Coward, fraud, liar...just a flea trying to eat an elephant. Please find something where you can get in the arena and engage.
That's Trudeau, selling us out to the Chinese. Hosting cash for access fundraisers and allowing the sale of Canadian firms to corrupt state owned enterprises from China. This multiple entry visa is a disgraceful idea. This Chinese must have something on Trudeau. I can't believe he is that stupid.
tell me lunatic where in our constitution does it say dental care is a right?????? no where of course, but as usual the lunatic lefties who want more taxation for more government to guarantee them money never ends
Bummer. Sucks to be you.
Hab fan loser
MAN--is a foolish clown --think to manage-- control nature---SOON the powers that be will decide on predator control hunts or something because things aren't balancing out as planned---crock  shoot-they will build more access roads so tourists can--- SEE A wild---animal-----now--about-"KING COVE ALASKA >>????
I am an accountant and I resent being called a bottom feeder. However I do remember one of my tax professors calling the "Income Tax" act, the "Accountants and Lawyers Employment" Act. Don't blame us for government stupidity even if we benefit.
The author condescends to Trump by suggesting he's probably too ignorant to know the history behind his America First slogan, and then he follows up with vocabulary that would fly right over the heads of trump voters. You've created a monster Krauthammer. Own him.
sounds like you are doing some smart things.  when you say "I'm going to.."  does that mean you haven't  - for a long time - or just will get it done in the next week or so.? i'm nosy and pushy :o       what's stopping you from seeing the doc about the meds and living situation?  the meds for panic attacks are very helpful, my sis deals with anxiety and the pills made a world of difference. opium is a bit strong, is dangerous  and wouldn't help the panic attacks.  wouldn't help anything.        i'm reading a lot of  "maybes" and "thinking about" in your post.  what is holding you back? do you have ID?  have you ever asked for --medicine and  talk therapy?  Aaron - you're a smart guy..don't be a jerk to yourself and stand in the way of accessing it.    forget lawsuits and that stuff  -for now.... just get your self  settled some place.  good luck..you gotta think baby steps
The incompetent-in-chief 's  racist, anti-semmitic, anti-immigrant pal went down in flames. In France, unlike the US, a candidate can't win the the presidency and lose the popular vote as doofus did.
Misogynist
This EPA chief is a disgrace, like the orange guy who appointed him.
ADN I guess you pick and choose whom you want the public to read from...I thought that the "press" believed in FREE SPEECH.. Get real with your  hypocrisy!
It's pretty simple, gather all the names from the ballets of  Trump supporters and tax every one of them topay for the stupid wall. They can even have their name on a brick!
What a joke, years behind schedule, multi-million dollars over budget! Prudential is just passing the expense along to all of us! Good job ruining Kirkland! Amy, Eric and all you other co-horts within the city establishment padding each other's crack! Fools!
You didn't just swallow the hook, line and sinker, Bavius, you swallowed the damned boat!
Here is some real b***sh*t. Don Young being a Congressman. We need to show him and Murky where the unemployment line is. Time to clean house.
When Stalin collectivized all agriculture and farming,  successful farmers were branded as enemies of the state, their  land was taken over  by   bureaucrats and useful idiots in the Kremlin.  They  took the USSR into famine and starvation, and called it equality.  The TDSP is doing the same on a smaller scale by knowingly harming intelligent students while calling their actions  " social justice".
Walker is gong to have to increase more taxes on gasoline to pay for these waste of Taxpayer money. State Motto should be spend money like an idiot, never cut the fat.
You don't even have to look at history. Look at current events. The Republican president is in lockstep with the KKK, is spreading the KKK's message, is being praised by KKK Grand Wizard David Duke. That same KKK grand wizard ran under the Republican party for the senate in 2016. The KKK / neo-Nazi rally in VA this past weekend wasn't titled "Unite the Left". It was titled "Unite the Right".   Republicans across the nation are waging a war of Voter Suppression, formerly the province of the Ku Klux Klan, including Kris Kobach, the Republican Sec of State from Kansas and the co-chair of Republican Trump's Voter Sham Committee.  This anti-black white nationalist "Unite the Right" garbage is in the Republican party now, currently, in 2017 regardless of which party Nathan Bedford Forrest belonged to. You can deflect, or you can work to purge these racists and their ideals from your party.
This is just political grandstanding. What a waste of money. Don't we have other things to focus, like our own corruption and government overreach than some Federal orders? Hawaii can do it's own thing, but suing the Feds just seems completely dumb!
A different kind of reporting?  Like you used for the past 8+ years under Dear Leader Obama?  As I recall, there were two rules to that kind of reporting: 1.  Always kiss his butt. 2.  When in doubt, refer to Rule #1.
Wow where did GM get this ignoramus of a hack calling athletes louts and saying Rousey is a feminist agent of change to MMA savagery -- she's the most unsportsman-like figure in all of MMA everybody is glad she's gone, she wouln't even shake girls' hand before fights and when women' MMA caught up with the men she got ploughed by everybody.       So you got an ignoramus to write his personal prejudices about a sport a few old people who read GM and have never been interested in anyway.    Look at the sportmanship between MMA fighters you imbecil, hate is rare in MMA unlike boxing, they fight like athletes and then they hug it out and shake hands...but there's no convincing you is there?   YOUR MIND IS ALREADY MADE UP SO YOUR EYES SEE NOTHING.   IDIOT.   unlike many other sports where a couple of wimps play and then act all sore and filled with injured ego when they lose.  Pfff.    Wow.
Bill O'Reilly is a narcissistic sociopath.  Innocent people who're in their right mind don't pay out tens of millions in hush money and attempt to blame others for their screw ups.
Lean pork is really dumb. Have these guys ever had bacon? Talk about solving a problem that did not exist.
Are you kidding?  Everyone I know expected McConnell to do this, including conservatives.  Now they own it.    Republicans are selfish,  lying, irresponsible morally and ethically corrupt, wholly partisan hacks. And I mean that in the nicest possible way.
Hillary is Satan's sister. The most disgusting, despicable, dishonest, disreputable, disgraceful, degrading, evil candidate for POTUS EVER!
Time to give Brock a chance.  Sorry fellow Bronco fans, we are not going anywhere with Siemian.  Really, I wish Elway would just sign Kaepernick as he is far and away the best option out there. It sucks to waste this defense because we have a dopey QB.  Maybe we can bring in Kirk Cousins or Drew Brees next year.
Disagreement on Bill Morneaus conduct? Well, fair enough, that's democracy. Blaming Harper for all this mess? Now that's just plain dumb.
m:  You are a lazy troll. They were posted and you are just too lazy to re-read them
There are many who idiotically point to Bill Clinton.  First, do not try to excuse Trump’s bad behavior with Clinton’s behavior, that is what children do.  I was not a fan of Bill Clinton and I am not a democrat. Bill Clinton received deferments just like Trump did. Bill Clinton was eligible for the draft in 1969. Trump was never eligible.  Trump is a draft dodging coward.  Clinton was a draft eligible weasel.  Big difference.  Why not bring up Hillary?  Hillary killed people so it would be okay if Trump was a rapist, right?
Not really. It makes Brown clearly either a liar or a fool neither of which helps his quest for power.
And yet, by voting for Trump and every other Republican for whom they voted, that's exactly what they voted for. If they were too uninformed, too incurious, or just plain too lazy to read in a seemingly infinite number of places that Republicans have been trying to do that for years, then their stupidity, as usual, is their own d*mn fault. They got what they deserve. Unfortunately for the rest of us, we didn't.
...because you don't like science?  Or you don't "agree" with science?  I've got news for you: that bucket and those tomatoes are both products of the science you love to hate.  While we're at it so is probably everything you touch.    But hate away and shower the world with your stupidity (and tomatoes) if you want to be juvenile about it.  The adults in the room will take care of things.
Why does the wind blow in Oklahoma?  'Cause Texas sucks...
stop deleting posts - simply ridulcous because one person is upset.  Give me a break.  the Globe is going downhill and fast.
O'Leary is a serious threat because you can never over estimate the intelligence of the electorate. Voters like simple solutions even if they don't respond appropriately to the complexity of the problem. They like to be told they are paying too much tax and that unions are the problem instead of themselves. And until Conservatives abandon the politics of selfishness and greed, acknowledge the fallacy of supply-side economics and understand that government has a significant role to play in an economy, they remain totally unfit for elected office. Sadly, we have examples of buffoons like Mike Harris, Ronald Reagan, and Rob Ford who remind us that voters are either irresponsible or stupid.
Says the retired garbage man, who seems to know 'exactly' what's 'good' for everyone except himself.
Trump ridiculous and unimaginative, as always." Let scrap this, let scrap that": what a man!
Ignorant and uneducated. Your intelligence is lacking at best. I'd be happy to debate you and embarrass you on the lack of factual information swimming around in your confused head.
While I agree that Lisa is bad for Alaska...the idea that she is a liberal is laughable for its stupidity. Lisa votes in lockstep with her Republican rw masters...that is a fact not #alternativereality
Trudeau speaks in progressive riddles and broad idealist puffery void of anything that could be considered a coherent message. His lobbying description is equivalent to suggesting sex with a condom doesn't count, he's embarrassing himself - Trudeau is regressing further into hypocrisy and ignorance by pretending that subscribing to a higher "progressive" moral authority gives him carte blanche to do whatever he wants. Just look at the climate deal, how much will it cost the average taxpayer? Eye rolls and contempt from Trudeau and Butts - don't ask questions, it's 2016, sunny ways and all that...
Evangelicals???? Oh yeah. The holier than thou's who somehow think they are Christians living gods words? To me, they are amongst the most prejudiced and self serving idiots around. They think they are going to their white mans heaven after their actions that are 180 degrees opposite of what their jesus lived and breathed. They defund, and support the defunding of programs that help the less fortunate, and give the same funds to the well monied the rich and the politicians corporate sponsors, the same kind their jesus punted out of the temples. The evangelicals thinking and expecting to go to their white mans heaven, makes as much sense as the Mideast terrorists going to their Islamic heaven with their 72 virgins after the wholesale slaughter of so many thousands of innocents. Washington is built on corruption, which is why we are sending all the taxpayer dollars overseas, unaccounted for with no accountability
WHY would you say that?  Why would you even think that?  Nothing at all (not her name or ANYTHING in this horrible story) gave ANY reference to nationality or certainly not anything about Islam.  What a ridiculous and very sad thought.  You are contributing to the sick mind set that Muslims are evil.  Ignorant and un-American. (no, I am not Muslim) Oh, wait...I know, TROLL.
Seems like everything that happens concerning vaping is embroiled in ignorance and stupidity. These people apparently don't realize that nicotene is not a carcinogen, a fact that's been known for probably 50 years. They also apparently never read the study by the Univeristy of Maryland years ago that did some experiments with vapists and examining blood constent. Nicotene is VERY difficult to get from the  eliquid into the lungs. My experience is that it is a total waste of money to put nicotene into eliquids. I have never gotten any effect, no matter how strong a dosage of nicotene I vaped. Vaping is THE most effective means of getting smokers to quit, and if anything deserves a govt subsidy, this does. Of course, the greedy govts are collecting fortunes from taxes on tobacco. Gov Pat Brown has put a tax on ecigs , pretending that they are dangerous. In fact, the taxes are because when people switch from cigarettes they avoid the tobacco taxes. Brown is one evil, stupid SOB
I hope the judge rejects this suit to show how dumb our AG is.  Can't believe our overpaid government officials are wasting time on this crap when we have real problems with actual US residents here.  Instead, lets make our country less secure and more expensive.  Ridiculous!!
Socialism is for losers
Disgusting, primitive, grubby thieves the lot of them. #Zumamustrotinjail  Time for the (few) good men and women left in the ANC to form a new party and leave the criminal syndicate they currently find themselves in. "ANC" is just a name. The ANC of Mandela, Sisulu, Tambo, Gordhan, can be recreated in a different guise, guys! Just pack up and leave the syndicate.
The squealing from loyal Liberals is always rewarded with a heaping dose of public slop.
Paul's wife or daughter are not the now unpopular Eugene mayor.  I see your making the rounds, and making excuses for our deceitful mayor.  At least with Paul, you can't patronize, "Pretty easy to do behind the anonymity of a keyboard and computer screen.", as you hypocritically told me.
Trump has a long list of things that came out DURING the election that would have disqualified him from office if America was a country known for having a sufficiently intelligent citizenry. What has come to light since the election--that Russia's Putin used various extra-legal measures to sway the American electorate (at least the most gullible) to not vote for soon to be former Secretary of State Clinton--is by far more serious since it has to do with a breach of national security, brought to light by America's intelligence community, that ensured a Trump victory.  We know Trump voters to be racists and misogynists but now must add to the list the word "traitors" since that is truly what these Putin-Americans are--fake Americans--who have allied themselves with an foreign power that seeks to dominate the American people.  Don "Dung" Trumputin should go to Russia where he belongs and take his dirty, racist friends with him.
The Supreme Court nominee was unanimously confirmed to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006 — by some of the very people criticizing his nomination to the Supreme Court in 2017. Snopes   Those hypocrites are known by their party affiliation - Democrats!
If what you say is true, it's pretty pathetic that the millenials main understanding about the Catholic church is its teachings on sexuality.  And ironic that the only ones talking about the Church's teachings on sexuality are secular homosexuals and feminists in the media, not the Church.  Meanwhile, countless young women are being pressured into being sexual objects by a culture that equates recreational sex with freedom and equality.  And the guys LOVE it:  No more having to take a girl out to dinner a few times to get into her pants!
It'll need a good fumigation once this traitor is ousted.
I personally could care less if Murkowski or Young are re-elected - but every time I read something by this author I am reminded why so many "so called" ignorant-stupid republicans and independents in Alaska don't embrace democrats all that much. I am also puzzled why Alaska's largest daily media concern doesn't realize that opinion pieces like this probably help to perpetuate the lopsided election results we seem to have year after year in this state. Good luck to democratic party candidates with cheerleaders like this.
klastri>  Silly you, ha, hah, hah!!!!
Gravity is a heartless b*tch.
Here we go again. I am so sick of this non-issue. Just make all bathrooms gender neutral. Problem solved.  For those of you who have so much spare time that you can afford to make an issue of who uses what bathroom: Grow up and deal with whatever personal phobias you have that create this kind of bullshit. The rest of us don't care and resent you wasting our time with your crap. Pathetic.
"Just" Planned Parenthood? Planned Parenthood is healthcare for women. And it wasn't "my" statement.  You're a shameless troll.
un - friggen - believable... this has all the hallmarks of the Catholic Church ignoring it's problems and thinking just by switching locations makes the problem go away.  ABSOLUTELY CRIMINAL the incompetence of Torres and especially of PPS!  - surviving Beach Elem. family
That is what it looks like to me, probably bought and paid for by the Koch brothers.  The Feds are the only ones protecting us in Alaska. The FBI caught the corrupt bastards club 1.  EPA caught the mines dumping toxins the state government is happy to overlook.  FERC caught oil companies inflating transportation costs which is the only reason audits have to be done.  The state didn't even want to finish audits and they don't want to collect the money. The Feds demanded Hilcorp fix the leak and inspect the rest of the pipe.  Our state government sucks.  Hasn't everyone seen state fish and game management? God help us!
bull s h it gun owners thumb sucking bed wetting cowards
unions and democrats are an addiction / cancer that has ruined Hawaii..
He's a narcissist.
I so support what you want to do, but I beg PLEASE DON'T EVEN GO TO THE FAIRGROUNDS.  GIVE TRUMP NO TARGETS - HE WANTS TO TARGET SHOOT.  LET HIM RAIL AND RANT AT HIS SUPPORTERS OR THE MOON - LIKE ANY LOON WOULD.  JUST DON'T GO!  PLEASE!  sorry for the shouting out but  - this is the best option. DON'T FEED THE TRUMP TROLL.
Dispose of Pyongyang and reunify Korea. Seoul has been the Capitol of South Korea for centuries. Pyongyang is a shadow of a puppet left over from the Cold War years. Pyongyang enslaves, starves and murders the people trapped in the north. They pitted neighbor against neighbor in a bloody coup to enslave all of Korea.Dispose of Pyongyang! Send the Kill Squad!
Like the majority of religions......the church preys on the weak of mind, guilty f heart and bereft of common sense.  Why yes it makes perfect sense for the clerics to have no spouse or family....perfectly natural. A money making machine with no soul and a sanctimonious facade.
"parasites"  Nice.  The G&M needs to add a "you're an a-hat" icon for its reactions options.
We should all rest easy that the unstable and unhinged lunatic Hillary won't have the football.
Joe's a dick.   Always has been.    He hates "Liberals" more than he loves Canada.   In other words, he's a typical CPC fanboy.
Idiotic comment.
They did publicize the evidence yesterday with the presidential order.  Mother Jones for example has the full FBI report, which granted has a lot of IT-speak and techno details. And is consistent with stuff you can read on Wikipedia related to the issue.     Not worth an all out war as it comes down to Russian GRU mainly bring asshats.
Republicans are a problem.  They'll believe anything:
"Donald Trump Jr. Is An Idiot." well, I don't think he's an idiot. In his zeal to promote his father, he made a rookie error. But Manifort should have known better and advised Jr. to turn down the meeting. Nothing (again) will come of this red herring.
I’m sick of it all. Just cap the PFD and put in an income tax in place……..they’re going to do it anyway eventually , just get it over with and STOP the flaking. The governor and the legislature have created chaos in the state by their alarmist B.S. . People are attacking each other right and left because they are so frustrated with what the upper administrative government is doing and not doing….. State workers are actually being threatened and treated like dirt for doing their jobs ……………….People it’s not the state workers doing it. People who’ve never had to pay an income tax can’t stand the idea of having to pay and they are the worst ones to scream, and they ARE screaming…… I hear a certain talk radio show in the morning and people call in there and actually BELIEVE that they shouldn’t EVER have to contribute by paying state taxes but they want everything the state has to give them.It's unbelieveable that people in Alaska are so stupid.  Talk about a bunch of spoiled backwards brats
The dead are beyond being insulted especially the fat and stupid ones.
Lessons from those numbers are The wealthy do pay taxes regardless of what some politicians continue to say.  The government spends the money they don’t need to earn...like drunken fools.
Stupid people will then just try to make it to the site and back.  I have no recommendation on what to do here.
No, the crime in the 70s was worse.  The "victim" needs to be charged with unlawful discharge of a weapon unless the crook was aiming to run him over.  Really stupid stuff.  If you are going to carry, know what you are allowed to shoot at.  The really dumb part is most folks get their car back.  It may be a mess and left in a bad part of town...  Crooks like this usually steal because of the opportunity  - most are not professional.
The Democrats are a bunch of idiots. We should cut government spending, cut unneeded positions and cut the taxes for local residents. (D) onkeys !
On this I agree with Trump.  These multi-millionaire athletes who insult the anthem or flag don't belong here. Send them back to the Hottentot chimps of the African league in Uganda. They're just silly uneducated folks that enforces the mental inferiority of many black athletes.  Put them in a military uniform and see how long they'll last.
White people suck.. Black people suck.. Yellow people suck.. Brown people suck.. Humans in general suck... Rant over thank you...
I agree that it's stupid to blame liberal policy (really stupid) but Alaska has definitely not "always been red." That's a new thing brought to us by oilies who brought evangelicals from Texas and Oklahoma.
If ever there was proof that Donald Trump is the poster boy of ISIL and Jihad, this is it. Already Islamic terror organizations are dancing with glee because Trump has handed them their raison d'etre on a platter. What a stupid asinine thing to do? Of course, the move to ban people from Islamic countries, the brain-child of the physically  repulsive S. Bannon, publisher of Briebart, a racist and antisemitic rag,who has been furtively moved to the American National Security Committee  is right out of Moscow Rules.   We can expect an increase in terrorist activities thanks to this horrible little man. Trump is not qualified and he even doesn't have nice hair.
There you go again.  'Most Canadians". What Canadians?  According to which poll?  This is as pathetic as the polls you were shoveling earlier this year about 'most Canadians' wanting unlimited immigration.  After the complete debacle over the US Presidential election and its polls surely people don't believe a word you and your embittered global masters say.
This is like letting your local grocer keep the change from your grocery purchases for a rainy day fund.  Liberalism is a mental disorder.
If you refuse to support yourself if you're capable of it you are by definition a parasite. Fools like you that believe that people have the right to sit on their butts and sponge off of others are nearly as bad...enablers.
Inconsistency ? I think you mean hypocrisy. Criticizing others for things you yourself do is hypocrisy. Trump has it bigly.
what is good for china has been theft and keeping its people down , not free. thus china is the trash the world should never copy
Justin is a waste. ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀ A roofer. So dumb that if he nailed his feet to a roof, he'd still find a way of falling off.  A total waste. ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀
Donald Trump will condemn anyone, including his own staff and fellow republicans, but will never condemn white nationalists or Vladimir Putin. If you don't see the type of person Donald Trump is by now, then you are as ignorant, evil, and arrogant as Trump. He's a blatant racist, he has no clue how to run a country, and he strokes Vladimir Putin when ever he has the opportunity. We need to get America back on track, and that starts with the impeachment of Donald Trump. Nothing in our country is going to improve until Trump is out of office.
And that is the job of the regulator not the peanut gallery making ignorant judgments based on fear.
When the Dispatch folds what I won't miss are jerks like you.
Trump is a raving lunatic. He didn't answer a single question last night with any kind of coherence.  Instead, he ranted and raved and slung insult after insult. He has ZERO diplomacy skills. Imagine if he were to have an interaction with a world leader acting like that. We'd be balls deep in World War III in no time.
Do you actually want the media to ignore what the President says?  Do you also want the media to ignore criminal wrong-doing by Presidents?  Why do you find ignorant and hate-filled messages, whether in tweets or speeches, to be a media-created problem rather than something to be reported and exposed to the 'light of day'?   Would you say that the real problem with the lynching of blacks in America during the 20th century was simply the media reporting those crimes?  It appears you simply want to turn a blind-eye to repulsive, and often anti-Christian, rhetoric by politicians you support.
Come on, you expect to registered (D)onkey voters whom voted in the dumbest politicians in the entire nation to actually think the rest of us are as gullible as they are? LOL
This pathetic turd should have been on many radars. How does military justice not transfer to federal lists? In 2014 when he abused his dog, they should of been able to check him out and find him attacking his wife and cracking his kids skull. What steps did they take to help this dude, and keep him in check?
JT has got to be nuts, nobody in Canada needs to speak an Indian language, if the natives want to use the language let them pay for it, why would we want to support another money stream into the reserves. If they want to  learn the language of the tribe they can pay for it themselves. Canada must adopt one common language and it is not going to be French but English.
if you're truly that ignorant why shout it in public?
"Thoughtful Republicans?"  What's that?  SEE the vote on Trumpcare today.  Their base will continue to vote them in, time and again, regardless of consequences.  SEE What's The Matter With Kansas?  You can't fix stupid.  SEE Trump and his supporters.
And that makes this right?   You Trumpettes will grasp at anything to deflect.   Your boy is a moron and a draft dodger.
They are kneeling DURING the anthem when the colors are displayed!! What else are we to think? If it's that's not obvious to you, read some of the player's statements. "Pigs" ring a bell?
The Republican weasel tells the cowering chickens in the coop that if elected it will protect them from the chupacabra. Once in, he will kill them and steal their eggs. That is the Republican party.
What is there to debate Trudeau is an idiot and a dick
He should veto such a stupid law. Russia is not our enemy and there is no proof of the alleged Russian meddling in the U. S.  Presidential election. Any measures taken to antagonize Moscow only serve the interests of the U.S. military-industrial complex. Any Western politician with an iota of common sense and concern for world peace should be doing everything in his/ her power to promote cooperation with Russia.
I'm so glad there are stupid people like this in the world.  Two girls stupidly posted a video of themselves throwing a rabbit into the walls repeatedly and laughing.  The rabbit kept running away and they would get it and throw it again.  If they had not been stupid and posted it then they would not have gotten caught.  These stupid girls were arrested for their cruelty.  They were in their young teens.  They were from a bad home. So sad, too bad.  BTW, the rabbit only suffered a broken leg and was immediately given a good home.  The stupid girls, well people get really angry about animal abuse, so they did not fare so well.
Waa, waa! JZ was mean to me! Try again, troll king!
Give the guard a medal and a generous gift card, he did society a huge favor.monly a bunch of looney ignorant liberal would cry over this monsters Keys' suicide. Good riddance.
You're an illiterate idjit. China has not bought Shell, and the refinery in Burnaby is owned by Chevron.  It's better to shut your mouth and be thought a fool than to open it, and remove all doubt.
Just an Idiot doper; Raises the most hell and contributes to least in any "constructive activity"....Send this dude over to fight ISIS...he may achieve an appreciation of the USA!!
If you were one day targetted by an ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BAN and forced to flee for your own and your family's safety, I am almost certain that you would not consider it fun.  What kind of stupid comment is that ?
Yes you are correct, the comment was crafted FOR an imbecile. Your second sentence makes me laugh out loud! Personally, I think you've got a little too much argot stuffed up your crass....
Victoria Leon Guerrero is a stupid white girl who pretends to be a native Chamorro.  She also pretends to hold a PHD, when, in reality, she has a terminal masters degree and will never have a PHD.  Stop playing Dr. Chamorro and go back to being stupid white girl.
The story about the awful alt-reich Evangelical Protestant preacher wannabes harassing the Latino congregation is awful.  Trumpkins tend to be bullies.
And you're voting for the pathological liar then.....
More manufactured fake news. First, Trump is not the founding father of the white supremacists despite all the media's attempt to make it look like he is, and that's ignorance. Second, his two day delay to condemn that group has to do with waiting for the facts to come out, and not because he supports them. The leftist media jumped the gun on several occasions, and many people paid the price for it with their jobs gone, but the fools never learn. Trump is an outsider, the establishment hates him -most Democrats and some Republicans because they liked their comfy business as usual positions to ruin our country.
A society that embraces abortion rights makes their women cheap, accessible, and exchangeable to wicked men.
I'm sure he will continue to fool the MAGAphants.  As trump lapdogs, they will watch Fox News and be bombarded with Koch Brother ads and be convinced their lives are better with each giveaway to the the 1%.  One wants to laugh at their idiocy, but it's not funny when the Clown-in-chief and his lapdogs implement their self-serving economic policies.
...he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton’s emails,' according to a statement an FBI spokesman provided to the Journal... 'Once the campaign was over, officials said, Mr. McCabe and FBI officials felt the potential conflict-of-interest issues ended,' the Journal reported."  So, Trump was "inaccurate" in that he rounded up from just over $675k, didn't distinguish between McAuliffe's PAC an the Va Dem Party PAC controlled by McAuliffe, and didn't make clear that McCabe wasn't solely in charge of the Clinton investigation. But, that's the thing about tweets -- the idiot character limit means it's hard to make distinctions, so that reading tweets make you stupider. However, this is what Trump wrote when in a less restricted format: "It was just learned that one of the closest people to Hillary Clinton, with longstanding ties to her husband and herself, gave more... than $675,000 to the campaign... (cont'd)
Many of the homeless and the transients on the mall fit into your "bully and harass" classification. They frequently are "jerks" to people who are using the mall for their business or enjoyment. Does this bother you at all?
' Oh, baloney.  And as for lying. …so why do you continue to attempt just that?
John Kerry.  You sir are an idiot!!  How in the hell did you become Secretary of State, and how in the hell did you become a US Senator.  Did your brief stint in Vietnam cause some kind of mental problem, or were you just always like that and nobody caught it?    North Korea is a "man made (looming) disaster".  Climate Change is a "natural phenomina" that needs no catalyst, but may well deserve some degree of human intervention to mitigate the effects - addressing the result vs. the cause.  You serve no cause, other than your own or AlGore, to make these ridiculously stupid statements.
Only a Trump can bring Canada back to its feet.The mediocre , corrupt, politically correct loony left is flushing this country down to toilet.
"(a few appointments have me concerned)"    The former head of the DIA Lt. General  he wants for an intel advisor (along with his idiot son) is the main one that I'm concerned about.
Seriously - how many white supremacists, neo-Nazis, etc. do you really think there are in America? A few hundred? A couple thousand? Hardly worth wasting time on these idiots. And they're certainly not swinging national elections!
a_r:  Don't be so foolish.  With a sales tax EVERYONE, resident and non-resident alike, will pay something, however "minimal", to support the state services they utilize.  Non-resident workers would pay a minuscule amount of income tax as most are seasonal and do not earn enough to pay an income tax.  Apparently you would like to give all the tourists, visitors etc a free ride.  I think they should contribute revenue to offset expense. Besides that what is wrong with residents paying something for state services and benefits?  Afterall you are happy for 50% of Alaskan wage earners to pay an income tax for those state services that benefit everyone, right?  Estimates are that a sales tax would generate twice the revenue of an income tax, but you know that too.
Helicopter rides for all of these media traitors.
Your an idiot and proving it once again . premeditated means you plan it, you set out to kill someone. They need to go to prison with issues like this happen but to say pre mediated just shows your ignorance along with this lady ignorance. No one that drinks and drives says hey lets go hit soneone and kill them. Maybe you should learn what words mean before you use them you clown.
"Where the population is majority latino, black and democrat Mr. Trump has been slow acting,..." Was he slow acting? Houston area and Harris County is heavily Democrat and went for Hillary. When you guys come up with a lie, at least make it a more believable one, not some pathetic race baiting rant.
Paul Elam??? Do we really need to drag a misogynist loser into this? Honestly, the man has nothing useful or intelligent to add to this debate. And Feminism ain't dead as the March on Washington showed.
When I said "drivel", I used the correct term. As well as spewing inanity about how everyone else should practice their religion, you are equally inane in bleating about the social sciences.
And you have that same old rotting Pinocchio nose telling lie after lie.  Your lying gets worse now that you're retired huh Chance?
DIVIDE AND CONQUER - It seems so far Trump has divided the UK from his detractors. By and large. It seems Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the UAE (where I understand he has business ties) are excluded and divided from their fellow Moslem countries), AND NOW IT SEEMS you are suggesting Canada has been (or is being) divided from the civilized world. Russia has been openly embraced, and the move is on to ditch Ukraine and Georgia, and the removal of sanctions seems to be on the agenda. Your run for cover is disgusting to me - it is appeasement - it didn't work with that other racist liar which cost the world so much in the 1940s. Why do you think this should be our national policy now?
Stop blowing the heads off unarmed persons.  That there are no repercussions from some pretty egregious police actions is beyond disturbing.  In fact, it is a tacit action telling civilians that rights are optional if it at all inconveniences the police.  Listen the Mark Fuhrman tapes.  "It was a good thing we had navy blue uniforms.  That way the blood didn't show and you couldn't tell if our uniforms were wet after we washed the blood out that got all over us when we beat some stupid n****."   And there's 19 more hours of tape detailing how they planted weapons, drugs, etc.  Or there is Capt John Burge caught bragging how he tortured confessions out of over 200 black suspects.  I have utter contempt for any profession that demands, not asks, but demands respect while so pathetically blind to the criminals in their own midst.

Lars, at least be truthful, & declare up front that you suffer from Putrumpski Undeniabley Stupid Syndrome & YUGE Simpletons disorder (PUSSYS). PUSSYS is a pattern of pathologically dissociative & psychotic behavior, first observed in the late hours of November 8th 2016, & increasing in severity with passing time. Sufferers of PUSSYS often exhibit pronounced cognitive dissonance, the delusion that they are the majority, sudden & prolonged bouts of self-pity coupled with inexplicable feelings of euphoria, feeling sorry for themselves & uncontrollable whining. PUSSYS are characterized by a persistent unwillingness to see that Donald Trump is a pathological liar who was put in office by Putin, not the American people, & is an illegitimate president. In moments of lucidity, they experience intense fear that Trump will be impeached.  Research is ongoing but PUSSYS appears to be prevalent in primarily conservative, profoundly ignorant, NRA Heavy, excessively religious red state populations.
clown.
You're an idiot.
Really? There are at best, a handful of posts that contain anything close to resembling substance in this squeal fest - but you picked this one. Telling indeed. Your government, like it or not, got more done last week than the previous administration was able to accomplish in 2 terms. While taking steps to address climate issues, he also approved 2 pipelines - dumb as a fox.
This jerk just can't find places to spend hard working Canadian's money fast enough. Common Justin, there must be a bunch of your warlord friends you can funnel Canadian's money too ?.   What a total disgrace as a Prime Minister and as a Canadian. But don't worry Justin, your time will be up soon enough
The resorts generally do not support the rescuers who are (usually) volunteers. Therefore the resorts are more concerned about offending the paying customers than enforcing the safety regulations.   But your main point is correct. There should be a way to penalize these idiots for this thoughtless behavior.
Haka is a total goof.  No way is it Hawaiian.  We need to do the dance if we win.  Which Rolo won't do.
Now you are talking erosion, they probably do not believe in that either. They only spew what Fox and Friends tell them to spew. You are right, erosion caused the Waimea Canyon as well as the Grand Canyon to form but these idiots didn't hear that one at Faux News.
I haven't missed an election since I first voted in 1965 at age 21.  I had to vote absentee when I was in the military, but I voted.  If they can't find their way to a drop box or pay 44 cents, they don't care enough to bother.  And they are probably too ignorant to make an informed choice, is my other belief.
Anything you can do to deflect the blame from the gun-crazy culture, huh? Pathetic.
Doesn't everyone appreciate an argument that outlines extreme political bias within the first few lines, lol  How are our Newspapers even allowed such bias..?  We no longer have a Free Press, but a corporately owned propaganda rag, employing the unskilled haters to write garbage for them.
Glenn you are one nasty, misogynistic individual.  Why does it upset you so that an intelligent young woman has a successful career?
Don't blame the cops. Blame the city's do-nothing for the tax payers and do-everything for the homeless travelers. If the cops were allowed to use force we could drive these leeches away.
Really a comment like stop your shit.ya that's the problem. Speaken by someone who never raised kids I bet. I was told that by mom dad and I turned out respectful to people. I have said that with my kids and they teenagers now and get good grades and are respectful kids. So try again with your hatred and lessons on parenting clown
So when in opposition, the Liberals used a picture of a drowned Syrian boy to attack the Conservatives, during election campaign time, it was later disclosed this family had never applied to come to Canada.  Then we had the Liberals attacking Harper over not doing enough to get the Egyptian journalist out of jail. Once free this man came to Canada months after being freed and during our election slammed Harper and campaigned for the Liberals.  Now when in power the Liberal Dione thumbs down an MP requesting help for a mother to get her children.   Disgusting hypocrites, liberals are horrible.
16 days- can't somebody distract this idiot
'“We’ve got to do a lot of education” of Trump if he becomes the nominee, Treadwell said.'  Republican speak for "The voters are to stupid to see it our way." They said the same thing after the last Presidential election.
Kasich is an irrelevant, fat, libtard sack of pancake mix...
You are a mentally unstable person.
No evidence of any collusion. Now, let's talk of the real collusion: Obama, Hillary, a corrupt FBI, and the Russian mafia thugs.
No, no, no, NOPE. How can she be charged with several offences when she did not break the law? That cop was either wildly negligent or wildly ignorant.
Yes.... yes.... I can see it entirely.  Our fine home arena's got a little too drab for champagne and caviar Bill.... so it's slam, bam, thank ya', ma'am... onto the next, new shiny, spotless, sterile one in order to keep up with them precious Oilers.  Struggling Calgarian families will pick up the tab anyways.  Just forget all about the good times we had back in '89 with Uncle Al and MacInnis' slapshot, eh ?  CUUUUUUUPPPP !  You disgust me !
It sure plays to the shallow simpletons like yourself.   Most intelligent people would prefer something of substance from this empty suit.
It is your opinion.   Own up to it, don't run from it.  You can't have it both ways.  You can't say Trump is a bigot, a racist, and fascist, and not at the same time by saying that everyone who voted for him is as evil in equal measure.  Take a stand.
This is b.s. She should do her research before shooting her mouth off. There are videos of Trump acting the same way while talking about other people who are not disabled. Also, you can see video of this reporter talking and he does not wave his hands like that. So Trump was not mocking his disability, his issue was with what the reporter SAID. But the media puts something like this out there and a whole lot of stupid people just buy it. Kind of scary, actually. And who cares what Meryl Streep says, anyway?
Only a fool is unable to see that Trump is much more worried about his fragile ego than acting like a leader. 3.4 million Americans suffering and dying and Trump tweets like a child about the NFL.  Nice. Wear your Chinese made "Make America Great Again" hat and pretend like you voted for an actual leader and not a petulant child with a twitter account.
I'm scared. Trump supporters have lost their minds and are openly contemplating armed revolt. They are no longer bound to the Republic and should be monitored as potential terrorists.
“Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups.”  ― George Carlin
hmm "Stupid Pills",,,,"loser".   The first refuge of limited intellect and unsupportable argument is juvenile insult.     Time to join the adults.   Perhaps had you actually lived and worked internationally for 15 or so years (I have by the way) you would not embarrass yourself with such unsupportable and foolish statements.
I have just cancelled my subscription.  I have tolerated the massacre of the English language far too long and this idiotic new comment system gave me enough impetus to cancel.
you're a dumb arse!
This guy is a asshole, he got famous for the Nixon impeachment, hasn't done one thing to make America great again since!
Family of traitors
Probably a pothead that broke into your car.  It would be typical for those type of scum
Your arrogant republican hubris runneth over again.
The real reason that Trump-lite Conservatives want to destroy public education is to generate even more dumb supporters.  Please stop the World, I want to get off.
Leave it to some Dem to find a way to politicize anything. Trolls.
The DOT is the worst state transportation dept in the country. Disgraceful, quit already you people are useless. This is going on 3 decades of abuse and incompetence. When is enough ? Another agency is ABSURD. Stop please and do your JOBS
In the movie, The Judge, the judge, played by Robert Duvall, finds that he is dying of cancer.  There is garbage living in his neighborhood.  The judge takes out the garbage.  Good judge.
Trump has all the subtlety and comprehension of nuance as a brick upside the head.    This idiot will pour gasoline on the fire that is the Middle East and in so doing create the kindling for the next generation to carry on burning.
Any religious idiot that won't help me out because I violate one of their idiotic, antiquated religious beliefs, the last thing I'd want to do is force them to interact with me.  I'd be afraid of some of that stupid rubbing off on me.
The idiot has the backbone of a jellyfish and brains of a slug. It's no wonder his discussions are top secret. The only true insights that we see of this clown is through his stupid tweets. What is more amazing is his Chumpsters who have their noses so far up his you know what that they've lost their sense of smell.
"A lot of fools bought the bs that Clinton is a hawk..." I can't imagine, looking at Clinton's history and what she said during the campaign about foreign policy, why you doubt she's a hawk.  "At the time, I told my questioner just what I thought a Hillary Clinton presidency might mean for America and the world: more saber-rattling, more drone strikes, more military interventions, among other things.  Our just-ended election aborted those would-be wars, though Clinton’s legacy can still be seen, among other places, in the rubble of Iraq, the battered remains of Libya, and the faces of South Sudan’s child soldiers."  http://www.commondreams.org/views/2016/11/15/trumps-america-and-dismal-tide
Berstein? Now that's a joke. Another lying leftist thug complaining that America has figured out about all the lying leftist thugs in the MSM. Go away loser!
Trump will have no time for idiots like Trudeau.   The lefts that put Trudeau and Wynne in power have ruined Canada. 1 in 12 in London Ontario on social assistance......1 in 15 in Canada on social assistance.....we are almost finished.
A dangerous lunatic man-child
And yet again the Donald shoots his mouth off before getting the facts straight.   Same with GM. Someone should tell him it is better to remain silent and thought stupid than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.
Pretend you are eating out in Australia ok. When this jerk acts out stand up and punch him out of his chair. One good head shot , he deserves nothing less.
What? That's more nonsense. Site your source on that silliness.  Now, you are just making stuff up.
Oh, right. Ridiculous.
Chrisin, that was a truly a idiotic rambling of nothing. You are correct this is not a left leaning country, Hillary is. What are you upset about??? I bet you are just ranting against the white man...
Disgusting!
I am very sincere when I state that you flatter yourself with the term 'Junior American'. As if. You also miss the mark, because criticism of a morally bereft and incompetent leader is open to anyone. What a hypocrite you are. You show up repeatedly on a website and tell us we have no right to our opinion. Stop the game, Wiggy.
Man why you spittin on minorites...not cool bruh. Probably mad you are as orange as Trump because off all that Doritos Dust piled up in your mom's basement.  Agheee bruh
A significant percentage of gun deaths are due to suicide and criminal on criminal crime. You are either ignorant on the matter or simply being dishonest.
"I didn't inhale"..... said by a another famous smooth talking liar.
If ever there was any doubt that Gregor Roberston is a full fledged imbecile its positively confirmed with these idiotic "praying" comments. Get real you flake. How embarrassing for the City of Vancouver to have this wing nut running things.
The US of A is fool's paradise.Within a matter of few years China has robbed America of its superpower status, jobs,homes etc pushing many below the poverty all through unfair trade practices. A Tibetan has beaten them in their own game  and brought back to America some of its stolen money,jobs and homes but the American govt treats him as a criminal and puts him behind bars (sic).Give him congressional Medal.
I agreed with you until the ignorant insults. Why not blame companies that make the decisions not to hire Canadians? Why not stop buying their stuff? Blaming Trudeau and the government is just stupid. They didn't make this situation - technogical capitalism did.
The road isn't maintained in the winter.   If you're stupid enough to try, stay with your vehicle and leave a trip plan with SOMEONE. It's easier to find your rig than it is to find you once you've wandered off. Your vehicle IS your shelter.
What a goon 😀
Get help for your mental illness. #TrumpDerangementSyndrome
It says that Keith Diggs and DJ17 are humorless dbags..
Anchorage - you should NOT be wasting time with this!! People actually have to use the bathroom of the gender they currently ARE because that is how they look! Ridiculous! (I take back the word "dumbos" for the sake of propriety).
You obviously have zero understanding of what an English Canadian is, believes and would do. The US is a complete mess, bankrupt, full of violence, loaded with weapons of all kinds and the target of most of the hate in the world.  Why would anyone, anytime, suggest such a ridiculous idea?
A little jealous perhaps?  But today we have the Donald as president.  A person who promised to release his tax returns but reneged.  What a coward!
Since your outlandish and ridiculous comment remains - I'll just put mine back, shall I?  Again, you're out of control with arrogance and hubris. I do not need you or nic to interpret my remarks.  I rarely call anyone a liar. But you, Sir....are
Good coverage by Ryan from the reporter.  The city council is about the last place we need partisan politics.  We need one strong council team pulling for the better good of Bellevue.  Anyone trying to turn the council into a partisan model would be foolish and will not be getting my vote.  Of the three Jared looks like the best choice.
It's only a matter of time before some young child is mauled and/or killed by this moronic "live with the bears" mentality we've presently been suffering with in our communities and neighborhoods.
I'm not saying Democrats are perfect but Republicans are crazy!
canadians are virtue signaling smug pathetic idiots
Doubt republicans will impeach the Donald the most corrupt president of all time.  Say xbt, are you proud that the Donald is standing up for his right to not release his taxes?  What a liar the Donald has turned out to be.  Of course is anyone surprised with the Donald's dishonesty?  Actually, be proud of your choice xbt.  Looking forward to your new minimum wage job?  Lack of healthcare?  Fact that you will be subsidizing the very rich now?  Enjoy.
Don't worry about how fat my children are!  Keep your filthy, disgusting and blood soaked hands off my children.  They will not be brainwashed into killing other's children all across the face of this planet!  F/U!
Sgt. Felix seems like a real peach.......a slimy, rotten one.
Yes you are a troll, even voted your own comment up. lmao
Where did that bit of idiocy originate?
Back in the 60's and 70's it was the rage of the left that it was global cooling... they shouted about the coming ice age... all due to man and oil. Late 80's they switched thier narrative in the opposite direction... "global warming"!! Due to man and oil. You do see point here???  Are you that young and dumb???
"satire"?  No.  "Stupid" yes.
A lot of those primary votes came from I's and D's (stupid open primaries).
Wolf!   WOLF!!!! Just where is that dratted old wolf anyway?
Jones and InfoWars are insane. Incredible.
The group responsible for wasting more tax money than the Eugene city council . Go and thank them for soon instead of a 15 min ride to the state welfare office on  11th the new emx will save 5 or 10 seconds. Then thank them for all the wasted time and money in traffic holdups. These people will spend as much as possible to protect their pers. I sent a meeting notice to President Trump, what fun it would be to have him show up and discuss monument building by idiot bureaucrats face to face.
Ridiculous comment.  trump interrupted Hillary 51 times because he is an obnoxious overtalking bully.  He is impolite and rude.  He even overtalked the moderator.  The guy is FINISHED.  trump has NO CHANCE now.  America has seen how ridiculous he is and there is no way the sane people will elect him.  There are not enough insane neo-nazi types either for him to win with votes.
So... This Liberal government campaigned on helping the middle-class.  As of January 1, 2017, they have eliminated the Education and Textbook credits that primarily benefited the motivated students of this country.  At last check, students are among the poorest in Canada and have had the highest unemployment rate in the country.  How exactly does cutting the Education and Text book credit primarily punish the wealthy?   Trudeau and his posse are the worst thing to happen to Canada since PET.
He pled guilty you fucking moron!
pretty stupid leaving your car running, leaving your keys in the cars, and as we have learned, leaving your bag in the car while filling up. take your keys, take your valuables, lock your doors (even while driving), because we live in the time of 'lawlessness'.
Translation: The defense is focusing on creating turnovers in effort to score points themselves or to create easy scoring opportunities for the Broncos inept offense.
You see what happen's when a Judge and our politicians bucks the president, he stick's us in the a$$ with a pay-back budget that would affect essentially every person in Hawaii. So sit down shut up cause we are Phucked.
Who is approving (and liking!) posts like this? It adds literally nothing to the conversation.  (Hint -- if you're going to say something is "ignorant babble," you should be able to explain exactly *why* you think it's ignorant babble.)
"Any bill regarding the oil tax structure has to answer one question: Will it increase production?" the statement quoted Kelly as saying.   Wrong.  The question that must be answered is whether it returns more value to Alaskans. Based on Kelly's criteria, the best bill would be to pay the oil companies $200 per barrel because that would definitely raise production.  When is Fairbanks going to get rid of that corrupt clown?
So you're saying that these teenagers, while certainly wrong, dumb, and clueless, deserve to DIE for this stupid stunt? I think that's a little much. They deserve punishment, sure. They should make restitution, some of them may even deserve jail time, but I think the Rambo fantasy goes a bit too far here. I'm sure none of us ever did anything stupid, destructive, or regrettable in our teens, right? Wrong, dumb, clueless, regrettable, destructive, and stupid all describe certain events in my own teenage years too. I'm glad nobody wanted to shoot me for it.
Good catch (whoever is responsible). I think Comey is a liar and biased and politically motivated (for HIS side).  He is also a lot of other things you think the head of the FBI would/ should NOT be.  As in: a little girl, a scaredy cat, a LIAR, a person with NO integrity, NOT a person of honor, a person who used his political appointment to further himself, someone who believes in a two tiered justice system -one for the Clintons -and one for everybody else, etc. etc. etc.   I could go on and on -but you all get my point.
Thomas Darcy Pathetic.
here is the thing. do your own thing, but quit demanding my acknowledgement, acceptance, and approval.quit telling our kids your filth is 'normal and progressive'. if you are a boy, use the boys' bathroom, a girl, use the girls'. all the nips and tucks in the world will not change the sex you were born. if i don't support abortion or euthanasia, don't force me to murder another person. and it matters not that a bunch of 'liberal christians (small c)' support things considered evil. we are warned about wolves dressed as sheep.
Simple. The Electoral College prevents one man one vote. Manipulating vote numbers by zip code so some count more or less than others. not justifiable in a civil society. An outdated relic is a  formula that fakes democratic principles indeed is what we have. How to argue against one man one vote is to favor contrivance and manipulation. And no partisan force can argue the logic from a partisan view.  It is a contrivance that denies one man one vote no matter how else Electoral College  is explained. The problem with numerical or popular voting as a system to which to change is the inertia and the centuries that have ensued down this wrong path.  To support that my vote will count more than yours is ridiculous on its face. .
Who will marry all of these boys who have no girls.  107 boys per 100 girls and boys die earlier for a multitude of reasons.  The 107/100 ratio is mother nature at work to counter the early death of boys.   Now we will have all of these boys who have no corresponding women and they will have to marry out side of their culture, which is okay by me, but an anathema to their family, and they will vilify the young man for dishonouring the family.  Simple yet valid conclusion,  people are stupid.
It's an inability to formulate thoughts in real time issue, not a speech therapy issue.  aka, dumb.
Versifal, seriously what rock did you come out from under or are you the typical BC Liberal troll. Most people on disability WERE in the labour force at one point as were many on income assistance. They did not chose to find themselves in the position of needing that assistance. You should understand  there but for the grace of god go you or I.  In the case of disable that happened either via birth, mental health issues, workplace, car or recreational accident. For those on income assistance it could be as simple as downsizing from a company and no other job available readily available. Unless you have walked in their shoes don't criticize. Many DID pay taxes but now find themselves in a position of need. People such as yourself think income assistance = deadbeat! Sad that you have such a narrow minded view, seems to fall right in with the likes of Rich Coleman's narrow minded thinking
Now you are getting ridiculous .  I don't have to "submerge" myself into anything to breathe.  Yes, we and plants need water as well as food to survive.  But that is to "survive."  Without Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide we wouldn't need them because we be unconscious in a minute and dead a minute later.  We don't have to "think" to breathe, it comes naturally, starting somehow in our mothers' wombs, and definitely when when we are born and "take our first breath."  Read my post to Neko, below.  It supports my position in this argument we are having about the authenticity of the science presented by climate change believers.
They're laughing at how the American public got duped by a low energy, overweight, clueless clown who now occupies the White House.
The US suffers from this man's complete lack of a moral or ethical compass. This kind of stupid bald-faced lie highlights his incompetence. His people cannot persuade him to be anything but arrogant. It is only a matter of time. The only question is how many of his administration will get sucked into the whorl of humiliation that the inevitable impeachment will bring.
This is as good as the 30 mph sign on Lauridsen. Sure didn't slow the idiot out totaling out my wife's truck parked on side the road then going extra 200 plus feet before coming to stop after hitting her truck, the curb, and a mail box only stopping cause a tree was in his way. Few of you seen the mess it was purple Ford Ranger totaled sitting in my yard back in April.
Darn.  For second there I thought you might be making a reasonable, thoughtful statement about the importance of the rule of law, but then you couldn't resist disparaging half the country just so people wouldn't think you're some awful conservative by doing so.  Well, don't worry, you're in the club.
There are an awful lot of rotten things about Trump, and the evidence is in his own words...or do you think "left wing sheep" made up the bit about grabbing pu**y, about seeing "thousands" of Muslims cheering 9/11, about accusing the Mexican Government of sending rapists, about his mad claim that "millions" of illegal votes were cast?  Perhaps it's the Trumpanistas going "baa, baa".
Black Pride = being black and proud Gay Pride = being gay and proud White Pride = NAZI! - Hypocrisy is worse than racism.
Nobody is dismissing. Why must you turn into a silly awkward caricature so many responses?
Congrats on the great achievement of confirming one of Einstein’s general relativity predictions.  And so much for the stupid Americans narrative of the smug USA/Trump haters….
Shame on Forbes for playing along with the immature guys on the inside "fat" joke.
Thank God we have judges that are not afraid to do what is right.  Trump is just a bully.
#1 Don't be stupid and leave your keys in your vehicle while it is running or at all. #2 Don't shoot at someone or a vehicle with other people nearby. #3 .Don't shoot at your or other vehicles unless your life or your family is threatened. #4 If someone steals your vehicle and threatens you with the vehicle or with a fire arm then by all means use deadly force.
Go away Carl, It is you that is Malignant and Irrelavant!
@ valleyisle57 Hey I didn't infer that  you are the idi0tic sarc poster.....cough
I find it interesting that many posters here decried the name-calling of President Obama and Clinton....  ....but have no problem with calling Mr. Trump names like "President Moron" and other nasty plays on his name.  Can you explain this seeming hypocrisy?
There was no chemical weapons attack "by" Damascus, you dirty old liar.
To all of you idiots comparing Lee with Hitler, etc.  That's ridiculous.  Hitler was evil, killing non combatants and trying to wipe out a people.  I'm not saying that Lee's belief in slavery was right, but it was a different time.  We see it now through a very different lens - the lens of time.  You must realize how people thought at the time is different than now.  You cannot go back and demonize someone based on the morals of today's world.  What did he do after the war?  After Robert E. Lee surrendered, the general was pardoned by Lincoln. Lee moved to Lexington, Virginia, where he became the president of Washington College. It is believed that he accepted this low-profile post, which paid only $1,500 a year, because he felt it unseemly to profit after such a bloody and divisive conflict. In 1865, Lee signed an amnesty oath, asking once again to become a citizen of the US.  He did so as an active encouragement for confederate soldiers to rejoin the US.  Such a horrible, evil man.
ISIS is a threat to the world. ISIS are our #1 enemy. Are you really saying that you'd rather have ISIS control Syria than Assad? Because that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. ISIS are our enemy, Assad is not. Assad has not made a single action against the US. ISIS live for our destruction.
This is one sick Zuptoid.
Listen you little sissy, keep your rubber gloves on. You're going to need them.   I think you're just pathetic whiner. You and your Left wing-Nut Liberal Liars are the party that got us in this mess.  We will get us out of it. Don't worry you big baby, you get to go along for the ride.  The Trump Tide raises all boats, even your little dingy.  And you think your last post was NOT rude and crude?  You really need to get on board son, you've lost your grip. Lets NOT meet.
Haven't people figured the left out. Sheesh,  just even google about how many people can be allowed on earth. According to some 7 billion people need to be removed so a bunch of perverts can continue on. Perverts like  aga kahn, as muslums like 12 year olds.  These scum want to try to take us back to a time long gone and we have paid for the technology to allow them.
Trump is rarely truthful. In fact, in my opinion he's a pathological liar. If he says it's raining, you'd better look out the window to check before you bother to look for your umbrella.
J.H., trolls are oblivious to their own hypocrisy.
Wow this guy is a real piece of work. Wrong on every count. Must suck to be sooo stupid
The duty and purpose of any Govt is to look after the interests of their own country.     How this is done is the real debate.  Eg:  Some would argue that Butt's should distance himself from Bannon (a racist clown) - but given that Butts and Bannon are meant to be behind the scenes - would that have better served Canada's interests?    They're both doing their jobs by "getting along".    Politics is a dirty job.  Same deal with Trudeau and Trump.    But Trump has clearly not acted in his country's best interests.   In 8 months he has pandered to JUST his core  support and has reduced the U.S. President's stature to that of an international joke as well as increased divisions in his own country (and party).      Trudeau campaigned on the left but has governed more "right" which is how Liberals usually govern.   But arguably - that is what they SHOULD do, since they are governing for the entire country, not just their supporters.   No govt should pander to JUST their own supporters.
There has never been a nominee put forward by a lame duck president such that Obama was....The Senate did their Constitutional duty..you are just a whiny liberal
Cassidy is a tool and Trump is a chump w a pre-existing condition of mental diarrhea
🔵⚪🔴🔴🔵🔻🔻⚪⬜⤵🔴🍎🍅🔴 okay I think I want Sun mother fucker to brighten my day
Bannon should be denied Communion if he is a racist. Bannon should be denied Communion because he is divorced. Ergo: Bannon is a racist.
You're not 907AK, you're just a troll
And why hasn't this thug cop been arrested? These BULLIES are getting out of hand !!
That is an offensive racist statement about Hawaiians.  Hawaiians have adapted in order to survive. That is why we are still alive and still exist in Hawai'i despite arrogant self-righteous racists like you.
Who wrote this Bullshit Story? The Chomorro's of Guam are laughing their butts off at that idiot in N. Korea
Jail the bastard. Why consider anything else?
Now, even the Republicans are looking to Trudeau to save them. Trump must that useless.
Racist cop killers!
this is news? who gives a crap
I understand your position, but let me bring a counterpoint. "Someone may be uncomfortable" is not really the best comparison. The simple threat of bathroom bills like this have resulted in more than 20 women being assaulted for being allegedly "transgender" across the country. Transgender people have faced actual bodily harm and death at a far higher rate than average society. This isn't simply "feeling uncomfortable" it's actually a matter of personal safety.  As for non-transgender people being uncomfortable: Why are we so worried about what other people are doing in the bathroom if it doesn't directly affect us? I feel uncomfortable around people that open-carry guns because I know there's lots of idiots out there. Does that means I campaign against the right to open carry? No.
Our Border problems has nothing to do with Trump all he said was  if you're a illegal criminal we are going to deport you.Trudeau being the savior of the world that he thinks he is, stood up and told the world that Canada will take each and every one and provide money,housing,medical,food just show up !! so who's the idiot here, it's not Trump
Trevor Story and his strikeouts are rally killers.
So, we have Treadwell and keller telling us what we should think? How stupid and sick, Trump is a very successful man and can lead this country out of the sick quagmire that we are in now.  Enough of the idiot baffons! They had there chances over and over again. Look where we're at now folks !
Not too long ago "Kirkland Urban" would have been a ludicrous oxymoron. It's disgusting and certainly not why I moved here to raise my family.  Kirkland didn't need to go down this path; letting developers permanently reshape and redefine your town is what you do when you have no other options. This isn't Detroit, we don't need help. Kirkland is thriving! And we can dictate to developers, not the other way around. Our City leaders are clueless and weak.  The Kirkland we all once loved is gone. But hey, if you need a nice shady spot to watch baseball you can always hide in the shadow of the new 8 story building that will be towering over Peter Kirk Park.  I can't wait.
"Do not tell me that this is about jobs and the economy". "We are stewards of Mother Earth and must make sure she is safe and can take care of, and provide for, our children and future generations."  Wow... aren't you special.  To suggest only indians care about mother earth....seems like  racist thing thing to me.  I believe all of us care about "mother earth".  The difference is that most of us have to make a living as we can't rely on handouts.  So yes---trade-offs have to be made.  Perhaps you could take less from the gov't, they could reduce our taxes and we could keep more of what we make.  Then  we could build less industry and hurt mother nature less.  Not willing to do that I bet.  Another hypocrite-- this time disguised as a concerned indian;
I guess I missed the memo that told every celebrity when they are in front of a mic to trash Donald Trump. I guess the mantra of,  when they go low we go high,does not apply,anymore. What a bunch of sick hypocrites
what about being brainwashed  by his dad and mom ??? ..... there  are consequences for doing stupid things
Moot Point that any 'muslim cemetery is even needed'.......they don't actually die...some  just procreate more terrorists.
Rupert Murdoch is a morality challenged, phone hacking, dirty old Aussie who LOVES sheep.  Quite literally !
Better get use to it Trump is probably here for 8 years, as the poor loser Democrats continue with their poor loser attitudes, they demonstrate just why the electorate through them out of office. Mr. Osama Obama was the most toothless President in history and leaves no legacy. There is nothing from that administration to build on.

I believe Trudeau has been quite circumspect with respect to any references he has made regarding Trump.   Moreover, your implied critiques of Trudeau for fostering bilateral relationships, working with the UN and making a point of standing up for the LGBTQ community say more about your appetite for intolerance than anything else.   Your partisan bile can't hide the fact that whatever disputes you might have with the Liberal government's policy orientation, or your personal animus towards its leader, the fact is that decent Canadians would be loathe to leave their women folk alone in Trump's company; and, decent Canadian trades and service people would think twice before working for Trump for fear of either being stiffed or subject to discriminatory treatment.  Trump is a vulgarian and an ignoramus. I doubt very much that he is any good at poker.
Republicans are a bad joke
Are American voters actually just stupid? A new poll suggests the answer may be “yes” http://www.salon.com/2017/04/26/are-american-voters-actually-this-stupid-a-new-poll-suggests-the-answer-may-be-yes/
"entirely unrelated... to my remarks on the topic"  Did you read your own original post? Four of its five paragraphs were silly partisan swipes at Trudeau. And over at the National Post you occasionally refer to the PM as 'Jihadi Justin'.  There's no fool like an old fool.
Why the hell is it always the taxpayer's problem? Do nothing - just let them die by their own hands which seems to be case. You all freak out about global warming. Well here's a good way to lower the population.  It's called self inflicted.   I didn't sign up to support deadbeats. I've got mouths to feed. Give those resources back to us so we can create an economy.  Stop sucking us dry for every deadbeat loser. Stop the BS
and yet another left wing idiot who attacks the messenger but can not refute the conclusions! typical of the left when they lose on facts
John "Cain" McCain is a turncoat traitor who ratted out his fellow prisoners in Hanoi Hilton. He has a dishonorable record of betraying our Country along with his dishonorably discharged from Annapolis. It is likely he is presently a controlled agent of the Red Chinese army. There is not one redeeming quality about this evil demonic America hater. And Lindsey Graham, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and other disloyal RINOs are bent on the same path. Google "McCain Traitor" on the Internet for further evidence of his crimes. May God soon take him away and send him to hell to protect America from his schemes.
And what has trudeau learned ?..a complete disaster and laughing stock...self righteous prig cant even answer a direct question in parliament..skirts all accountability...he is a true dictator.
Spoken like a true Dummycrat. The "rich", is everyones employer fool.
Ige and Chin remind me of two punk kids at school who like to disrupt the flow of the classroom by acting dumb and asking unnecessary stupid questions just to give the teacher a hard time.... They are so juvenile.....
Well Well all Republican Ass Holes that wanted Communist Cuban Cruz lossed, netx time you jerks listen to what the people wanted not Cruz. Just like when I found out they too Trump's ballots out back and burned them in garbage can.
all you guys are doing is excusing and enabling lazy ass trump and his killers while whining til the cows come home. we always have the answers but all your bunch has is NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! the homeless work harder than all the righty crybabies combined.
Unless you're a lying, racist birther for 5 solid years, right como?
It's the same everywhere, not just the US. Yet Trump and his ilk expect the world to bow to them and give the rest of us the short end of the stick. His tariff talks will create trade wars and make everything very expensive in the US. Does he really think no one will stand up to these threats? He's all about him and how no one else in the entire world is of the same caliber or worth (and I don't mean $$$-wise). Me, me,me, I,I,I. The man is a narcissistic mental midget who is mentally unstable on multiple levels.
Kefka, you are an exceedingly dishonest and disingenuous person, as anyone reading this futile exchange with you can readily see.  You merely and repeatedly engage in sophistry and evasion when confronted with the REAL issue at hand, and just why is that?  Over and over it is pointed out to you that it is largely the EXTENT and DEGREE of the influx of foreigners into various Western nations which is the problem, but you refuse to even acknowledge the argument, much less the fact of the matter, choosing instead to quibble about the definition of this or that particular foreign migrant that is part of that current, problematic and unsustainable influx.  Let me see if you will acknowledge this statement: it is not the STATUS of the collective influx of foreigners that is the problem, it is mainly the NUMBERS of foreigners flooding the borders of many Western nations which is the main problem at hand.
You're a T R O L L You faked someone else's name and you've been trying to make them look bad. What you did on those articles about those unfortunate deaths was unforgivably bad. Get your own name or just go away. Quit trolling other people's names, quit trolling the real 907AK.
scary, hairy, pot-bellied men!
"I had relatives killed by fellow Christians in Ireland during 'the Troubles""  Liar.
Ronni:....well that takes care of that.  1500 people come out to march against racism and you simply dismiss them as "just another bunch of deadbeats trying to conflate Trump with racism."   Actually, the person "conflating" Trump with racism is  David Duke.    David Duke, the former KKK grand wizard, is unambiguous about what Saturday’s alt-right and neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, means to him: It’s the fulfillment of President Donald Trump’s vision for America. “We are determined to take our country back,” Duke said from the rally, calling it a “turning point.” “We are going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. That’s what we believed in. That’s why we voted for Donald Trump, because he said he’s going to take our country back."    It's no big secret that a solid part of Trump' base of support encompasses the ault-right, the white supremacists and the white nationalists.  It's silly to attempt to deny this relationship...it's right there in front of you.  Gary Crum
"The most stupidest?'  I think that would be yours Big Glenn.
WHY was THIS commented DELETED???!!! "soundofreason  17 hours ago  This is the WRONG state to EVER be criticizing ANY one else's tax policy. Hypocrisy at its best.  Article might have well have read..."Feds take the next increase we were going to hit you with"
This guy is a waste of good oxygen.
You are the cretin.
Neo-CONservatism resurrecting and revealing the true nature of the Republican Terrorist Party in all of its forms, nationally and locally.  The Republican national nominating system offered a group of white men competing to represent the values of Old South christian fundamentalism in all of its racist, bigoted, misogynist evils.  Each trying to cater to the White Supremacists and religious patriarchy idolators still infecting the nation since the Civil War and Segregation eras.  The Trump "winning" despite the worst female hatred ever seen in a candidate released the hounds of racist bigotry, coupled with Corporate Media slavering, salacious broadcasting, to make it all acceptable not only in private, but throughout the public discourse.  Every insane White Supremacist idiocy joined with religious anti-human dogma became acceptable.  Now, the ultimate Alaskan purveyor of it all is elected and allowed to fill the media and government with traitorous actions and language.  Disgusting.
Tweeting From the Safety and Comfort of His Golf Resort In New Jersey, Trump Can't Stop Attacking San Juan Mayor What a vacuous buffoon he is.
Another slap in the face and a kick in the rear-end, so what! Perseverance will prevail...The "Clown" does not get it yet! He will go for a 3rd " trial" ...no pun intended!
The gun is the problem?   Are you stupid?   There was a attempted sexual assault near East High School.  The assailant was attempting to use his penis to rape the victim.   Was the problem the penis or the assailant?   The issue I find insane with you idiots that go after guns,  is you aren't fixing anything.  The criminal that is capable of taking a person's life is still there,  whether you make it harder for everyone to buy a gun or not.   Stop being so F--ing lazy,  if you feel the need to fix something,  fix the mindset that thinks murder is an acceptable action.
Worse and worse... ▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀  Clapper's gone rogue.  A liberal liar-to-Congress who's trying to sabotage a huge amount of business intended to ensure that we'll all have fuel for our vehicles in the future. Exxon is one of the biggest players in Russia, but then there are all the leaders in horizontal-drilling. Russia is a huge producer, and by far the largest oil resource in the world is the Bazhenov formation.  Given our lack of presence in the North, the Globe should refrain from stirring up hatred that could come back to bite us.  Liberal stupidity.
Are you seriously proposing the death penalty be reintroduced for stealing a vehicle? Do you realize how idiotic that sounds? As your man and a horse analogy and this idiot with a gun both demonstrate, a long standing problem in Anchorage is that we have too many cowboys who think this is the wild west and that disagreements and property crimes are best solved with bullets. Don't leave your vehicle running with the keys inside. Get lojack. Whip out your phone and call 911 instead of your gun.
No thought police anywhere around. Just people who find it difficult to understand the admiration some non-Americans have for this man Trump, who is so obviously a fool, who thinks he can, no, absolutely has to cock a snook at the world. Even his personality is unattractive.
Skankles is such a liar, thief and evil,  dishonorable, foul-mouthed, military hating witch and yet you don't write one word disparaging her. Hypocrite.
This further validates (as if any more was needed) Trump's obviously diminished mental capacity.    Trump is a moron and should be removed from office.  A worthless piece of garbage.
There is only one word for this; disgusting.
there is no end to the stupidity and bs the left is capable of doing, america thankfully has rejected left wing bs
Trulander is a hopeless moron, w/ no chance. He was thrown into pwr like a hurricane, by politically uneduc voters & media party, despite having resume of McDonalds employee. He avoids answering any real ?'s, & when he does, he speaks in platitudes & dances around issue, w/out answering the question.   Wut is he supposed 2 stand up 4? I'm not only 1 asking this either. Trump hasn't done damn thing 2 CDA/CDNs or said anything. Trulander has NO PLACE 2 TELL leader of ANOTHER country wut 2 do, if that's wut this is getting at. And nearly 80% of wmn said this BS? LOL! This "poll" of ONLY 1000 ppl out of 36 MILLION is NOT accurate in ANY stretch of the imagination & prob conducted in GTA (50% immig).   But keep propagating #fakenews & skewed/biased results just like US MSM. All it did was DISCREDIT media. I hav over 3000 followers on twitter, a good 2000 r CDN, ALL supp Trump, & a lot r WOMEN. My numbers climb daily. It just tks quick look at soc media 2 c where ppl's ACTUAL views are.
Ha ha! You fool! You fell victim to one of the classic blunders - the most famous of which is "never get involved in a land war in Asia" -- Vizzini in The Princess Bride
Oh....I've never met you  KONRAD YAKABUSKI  and what you write and your opinion pieces tell me you are not a very nice man.  You're elitists, arrogant.  I'm tired of elitists G&M writers and so tired of PC world you and your peers are trying to shove down the throat.  I like President Trump give him a chance.
You are nothing but a troll trying to hide behind other people's accounts.  Get off.
Hahahahaha! They are all crooks!
Talk about a useless stiff.
You're insane. And you say insane things.
Oh yeah, sure...kiss his legislative agenda goodbye ???!!! Go crawl back under your rock, you idiot!!!
No. Uber's business model is more akin to just letting. They connect private owners with renters. They do not sell your car and they sure as hell do not get to do it without your consent and they have to pay you an agreed share of the revenues.  Uber is one of the most evil companies in existence (so I use lyft instead). They have less respect for the rule of law than the Gupta family. They constantly break everything from tax laws to sexual harassment laws. They have been  convicted of large  scale fraud, deceptive business practices and false advertising over and over. And despite being nothing but thieves they have never made a profit. It takes a special kind of incompetence to make constant losses as an organized crime operation.   But this particular theft they are innocent off. They are quite evil enough in reality. We do not need to invent additional evils on top. The biggest concern in this regard is that, as per DM reporting, it's impossible to earn more than it cost driving
what an idiot comment, it is treason to bulldoze citizen's lands for an American company, with a criminal record of fraud in the USA  to profit on raw assets of Canada and sell it to China while ruining lives in BC and BC's economy for it. It's also market fraud; additionally it is not constitutional nor isn't legal internationally to extort money from tax payers to fund their "safety" and "spills".
Mr. Trump is a psychotic.  He cannot be removed from office soon enough.  He is a disgrace to the United States.
Trudeau speaks out of both sides of his face. In one breath he's telling Trump he's ready to get down to business and that he'll work with him. And the next he's tweeting how proud he is of Canadian women opposing President Trump. He's nothing but a  liar​ and a hypocrite.
The only laughable thing Sheep is people like you that deny reality. I don't know if you are serious or just trying to stir the pot. If you are serious, then you truly aren't the sharpest knife in the block are you
You're a troll.  That's not your account. Look at the space between the M and P.  Get your own account, troll.
When you old shrills die off, logic will return and we will overturn your silly regulations.
Yes- *"simply"* stupid.
You are sick!
The media is liars, the 3 individuals he put on his campaign are liars...everybody is a liar except the spray tanned narcissistic conman himself.
"Standing up to Russia"  What the hell do you think you are talking about?  I've seen your posts before.  You're too smart to believe that crapola. Why are you playing the fool?
Is Parnell an imaginary friend of yours that dreams up this nonsense?
People do not believe him because he is a proven liar, and because he rules by his crazy brain. He is not fit. The proof is right in front of you.
only commie  assholes have rights ....isn't that so mr. blitzer?
Oh, she sucks, to be sure. Why the Dems put her up is beyond me. TERRIBLE choice. If she wasn't up against Der Trumpenfuhrer she'd be losing right now.  However, I'll choose "sucks" over "sucks and is nuckin' futz" every time.
I worker at the Yale School of Medicine at the time this study was conducted and subsequently released. In discussions at "morning report" the consensus among the medical staff was you get sued for being a jerk to patients and their families not for bad outcomes.
Without his crazy, ignorant, and bigoted fringe Trump would not have had sufficient votes even to carry the electoral college (which isn't a done deal!) And before you start, don't even think that that benighted ignorant bigot fringe is in any way analogous to any left-wing fringe in the USA.
Richard, I called you on your hypocrisy..  You accused others of using phony names when you've done so yourself.  If you dislike being called on it, stop being a hypocrite.  Khalas.
Trudeau is just following in his fathers foot steps.  Both of them are honourable bare faced LIARS.  We in the West are glad Quebec is happy.
''Kelly was a jerk'' says the guy who comments on an article about a man who was killed in a plane crash. I didn't care for his political views nor his brothers much but geez Frank the man just passed away and all you can think of to say is the guy was a jerk? Nice. Full of compassion for your fellow Alaskan I see. Karma is an evil bitch Frank.
The entire trump effort is deeply flawed and inept.  Trump may be clownish but his ineptitude threatens Hawaii and all of us.  We live in scary times with a dunderhead in charge.
Good one--"if blacks don't vote for Clinton." You might add "if the earth stops spinning on its axis."  Also, I don't think name calling is all people who hate Trump have left, rather I think they simply enjoy venting their spleen on him since he has made Americans look like racist idiots. Plus, he's so butt ugly--he obviously only gets laid by having piles of money.
Trump and his cronies are so corrupt. Bunch of liars, who hopefully will be gone soon!
I know.  It's like jousting with a 10 year old.  Really pathetic for an adult.
Good no wonder they were winning so many segments, crappy toyota 😝
[Consider that you were just being told how you come off sometimes.] Do you presume that I believe you?  That's idiotic given how much you've proven to make stuff up.  But I provided you an opportunity to demonstrate how you are addressing how I write rather than attacking my character with the intent to evoke an emotional response.  You failed to do so. Thus there is no other plausible explanation than you are trolling. If you want to rationalize that as "anything you don't like is trolling" that is your foolishness and no one else's. [you keep all those old comment?" No.  You just had the bad luck that I kept that one as an example of CC's hypocrisy of what is "civil."
Kizilla you and the rest of the idots on this paper should start report and quit being numbskulls and I don't giv a damn if you block from this forum because you are trying to impress your will on free thinking people. The Denver Post is nothing more than a pathetic progressive left wing tool. You force readers to rate comments if you want to post one and then want to force us to rate them to your satisfaction. Go to hell you facist pigs.
Ya, and you replaced him with a selfie and hair-obsessed moron without a brain in his head. Well done.
Pro-lifers pay for your stupidity and inability to regulate yourselves.  We may not like paying, but we pay, which is more than you do.
gobab ...Your comments are completely unfounded ....bias... and and are nothing more than the rantings of an uneducated small minded homophobic moron!! get educated and study Indigenous history .!! before just spewing rhetoric !!
You're a TROLL.  You're not 907AK.
The DOD is run by idiots who stand by while HFCS, 56 vaccines by age 60, fluoride poison in municipal water and toothpaste, FRC in every mattress and every thing, Rumsfeld's aspartame, and GMO food makes the youth of the nation fat and stupid.  While the DOD bothers itself with trannies, homosexuals, and moms in combat, the communists, darwinists, and Satanists ruin the minds and lives of public school children.  The DOD idiot solution will undoubtedly be more foreign nationals in the military, probably from the heart of Islam and mainland China.
It's not illegal to accept and receive dirt on your rival. And who wouldn't? U think if Huma had similar opportunity for dirt on Trump, she would have said no??? Geez you clowns, give it a rest! You are a joke.
Right on, Janette. Let's also save some scorn for the people who keep voting these clowns into office, time and time again.
I remember them saying that.  Curious what those messages said?  Too bad they didn't report it.  Might've tripped up the idiot's plans.  Even if the AF reported it, with the number of guns and the lax laws that control private sale, it's likely the nutbag would've gotten them anyway.
Ah yes, it will be just so interesting to see what kind of "style" emerges in Washington when a lying, authoritarian, racist, bigoted, xenophobic, misogynistic sexual predator gets elected to the White House. Yes, his "style" will be fascinating, for sure.
Tell me what will it take to get them off their knees and start standing for the anthem? If they felt by pissing off a large number of NFL supporters by disrespecting the flag was a good way to get people to join and support their protest, than they were just flat out stupid.
Then vote to censure him. Wringing your hands to the media is one thing - still supporting any of his agenda means you still are with the Nazi sympathizer in the WH.    Better yet: start the removal process most likely to get this racist incompetent game show host out of office.    The sooner the country puts this idiot behind us, the better.
How the hell does Amy Demboski have a radio show?   How does that shrill idiot not recognize her hypocrisy?  Are there really enough mouth breathers buying products from advertisers to keep this moron on the air? i just don't see enough pick-ups flying Confederate flags to warrant her existence. apparently they're like cockroaches, for every one you see there are 1000 you can't see.
There is absolutely no need to explain or defend against his hate speech. Wasilla should be ashamed of itself for electing this knuckledragging moron.
Any destruction of Alaska's Grand Nature by the oil n gas industry means the industry needs higher standards.  The state needs to be the state (tax, regulate, oversight) and quit trying to be a partner.  Public/private partnerships are stupid.  Good read!
Justin is nothing more than than an eco bully. So much for his famous listening. Now he can go tell all his celeb friends how effective he is, what a moron.
I can't believe someone actually wrote this comment.  Unbelievably naive and more or less ridiculous.
Hawaii, this joke is on us!!!!  This is nothing but a big joke and the obvious stupidity of the decision made by a Harvard educated federal judge pales on the failure of a renowned educational institution to produce top-of-the-line lawyers.  How did he get his JD, maybe because he is ethnically a "minority?"  I ponder the decision and the very meat of it and cannot grasp how such an erroneous decision could be conceived.  The law is the law, the Constitution is the Constitution, why is there so much latitude that a decision of this nature could be made?  This is so crazy, and ill-devised that it is shameful for all of Hawaii.  The FJ is in the "I am above the law" zone and needs to be taken down a notch because his bad attitude clearly shows.  POTUS should just say you're fired or just ignore the decision and override the it.  End of  story!!!
says an ignorant idiot with no clue how a good economys works or the value of oil we can sell to support canada
It is until reality hits and they're sued for refusing entry to a legit student from OSU or PSU. These guys are fools to impose restrictions on everyone but Oregon students. My UO student daughter and I will be sure to avoid any business affiliated with the owners and that includes Oregon Taxi, who hire the most dangerous rookie drivers in town.
<The upside of renting is having more money to travel>  ... until you run out of money, idiot.
And if an employee cannot live on the offered wage, he/she should get another job. If such employee fails to command a higher wage for the work provided, clearly we're talking about a deficient and failed employee.
PROGRESSIVE CANINE COCK HOLSTER MOUTHS A BY PRODUCT of HAVING a MUSLUM---NIGER ---PUNK---- PRESIDENT
We cannot even trade beer freely across provincial boundaries and these fools talk about pot.
Yes, an officer that violates federal law without a warrant is scum.  But that isn't very nice language.  Criminal will suffice.
Well, at last they had to go back to 2013 to find a picture of him looking like a little, sissy school girl. And while wearing a cowboy hat no less. Are those the gloves of a cowboy?    I'm sure that if he had been wearing nice leather riding gloves, we would have never seen the picture.
Trudeau is too stupid to know any better than to legalize another drug but Blair, a former cop, should.  The moral race to the bottom.  What do the medical doctors across the country think about addicting 18 and 19 year old youth ?
What does Canada care? They have an fool for a leader and the people are seemingly happy to allow their country to be overwhelmed with immigration.  Criticising the UK for at least attempting to take control of its own affairs just sounds pathetic.
Elimination of criminals is a public service.  Of course some folks are too stupid to understand the truth of that statement.
Yes the citizens indeed elected this idiot. Not Vancouver's finest moment.
hey boy, talk big, you say there is corruption, then prove it.  enough of this stupid nonsense, you sound like a 5 year old.  you don't like it, then move, nobody is holding you back.  just get the hell out of here, you really don't belong here, no rednecks.
For the very same reason that they endorsed Harper, of course.  Even to the point of the absolute ridiculous :  http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/the-tories-deserve-another-mandate-stephen-harper-doesnt/article26842506/  The stupid, squeaky wheel now gets the grease and drives media revenues.   Hopefully, a strategy like this still backfires in Canada.
Has someone hacked or taken the name Diane Marie?  Where once this person comments has some degree of intelligence lately they have all been dimwitted in their deflection of Harper did it or it's all Harper's fault that Trudeau does what he does.
klastri>  Everything with you is psycho this, psycho that, you must be the psycho.  Since you are so wound up with the word.  What you say about Trump is fake news which you continue to spew just like vomit.
lol suckers
Look at south end of Forks, a real garbage dump, with criminal illegals living there, right next to visitors center! How nice! Welcome to Forks and the garbage Dump trailer park that looks beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOL LOL LOL LOL LOL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Delete
A general entry for the CIA in Wikipedia.......geez.  Now you've passed Weak and are approaching Pathetic.
That's just plain stupid.
If you take the original  meaning of "dumb", you'll agree that Trump is quite the opposite.  Let's just stick to "foolish".
probably planted by a weeping Hillary lover, in an attempt to show one last time just how evil white people are. All you people yakking about this crap are swamp rats. America told you what we thought of you, now go. No? Didn't think you would, those fat, fat paychecks from the taxpayers are soo addicting. You vermin are all going to have to be drug out of your rat holes one by one. Fine with me. To your pitchforks, men!
Self important too, huh?  I am having fun with you.  Intensely personal - you think my comment was intensely personal?  Really?  Saying that I am a patriot and prefer intelligent, productive, constructive conversations and even disagreements is intensely personal?  Claiming I am a patriot who loves country first is intensely personal?  And you have a self inflated view of your impacts.  If anything, your impacts are to draw real Americans together against your hateful, mean spirited rants and your stupid come backs that you think are clever.
jeezus Lesia, it's 5 mins to 1! don't you have work tomorrow? or did you quit to troll online full-time?  as for my opinions, those are based on things i see, read and hear. you are the one presenting your view of the situation as fact.   oh and the "two possibilites" that you've allowed me aren't really the only ones, are they?  anyhoo, i'm beat and going to sleep. i don't see much reason to continue our dialogue. i'll just look out for you in the future, and will happily joke around at your expense.  cheerio, and good morning to you i guess.. thought you were local.  p.s. i wouldn't call you a ukrainian fascist in a skirt, but that doesn't mean you ain't one ;)
Puny person.
Good lord it looks like mr. zipper plat is being duped by alt-right fake news just as the so called president is. It's a plague of ignorance and even the POTUS is immune to the affliction. Anything that reinforces that latent need to hate, fear and look down on some other group is swallowed whole and never ever questioned. What next?
Yes but we are talking about a man who praised a brutal dictator on the international stage, the fool still thinks we live in the 70s!!!  His credibility is free falling.
Dershowitz is a scumbag who vocally supported torture under the Bush regime.  His "ethics" are whatever suits his whims from time to time.  He is a perfect acolyte of the Blue Church.  A really bad man.
Hannity is a trump clone if it's not good trump it's no trump on his show after all people who what Fox beleive in big foot,ufo,swamp monsters and all that made up tv crap.
I was just telling them who Harburg was, as should have been evident even to you.  But I suppose you could not pass up an opportunity to make an inane, irrelevant sneer. You, who preach that others should be humble and Christlike, seem to think that nastiness for its own sake is good.
Lifeguards are useless.
Well the Dumper Post has a Indian idiot writing with this guy!
